I have an announcement to make…

I have accepted a position with [Acadia](http://www.acadia.com/).

[![Acadia](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png "Acadia")](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)My new title is *Principal Technology Consultant*.

In my new role, I’ll be helping companies realize and harness the full potential of private cloud solutions.

At this point you might be asking, well, several things… so let’s start with a F.A.Q.

*OMG! Are you on Team Edward or Team Jacob?!?!?!?!!!*

[![Team Edward Jacob Trey](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png "Team Edward Jacob Trey")](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)Great question! Twilight fans will be happy to know that I’ll be reporting to [Trey Layton](http://www.ethernetstorageguy.com/), Sr. Director Worldwide Solution Architects at VCE / Acadia.  Team Trey will be pulling out all the stops to help customers design and implement technologies using the [Vblock](http://acadia.com/solutions/vblock/index.htm) portfolio from [VMware, Cisco & EMC](http://www.vcecoalition.com/).

I’m still based in Research Triangle Park, NC and Missoula, MT but anyone that knows my background also knows [you can find me on the road traveling for customers](http://www.tripit.com/people/cuthrell.com) and [industry events](http://plancast.com/qthrul). Of course, when I am back in the Triangle area I expect to get lots of quality stick time on the amazing environments here in the new Raleigh, NC office where Team Jonathan (Jonathan Donaldson) drives vertical solutions on the [Vblock](http://acadia.com/solutions/vblock/index.htm) architecture and performs customer facing engagements.

*Why join forces with VCE / Acadia?*

I’m going to be perfectly frank. I think [Vblock](http://acadia.com/solutions/vblock/index.htm) architecture rocks. Oh, you wanted more? Well, as you may know, I have an affinity for startups, service providers, and investment groups.  Previously, I’ve been a CTO, VP, GM, Infrastructure Architect, and most recently an independent consultant with [my own consulting practice](http://fudge.org/archive/back-to-my-consulting-roots/). During my career I’ve *been arm in arm with service providers* as their data centers have evolved *and* I’ve also *been the service provider* experiencing that evolution first hand. Having sat on both sides of the table, this is an exciting time for me.

*What caused you to make this move?*

Of course, [I’d known about Acadia](http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2009/11/introducing-acadia.html) and [I’d known about VCE](http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2009/11/announcing-the-vce-coalition.html) for a while. I had formed some early opinions… lots of opinions.  I did my research.  I attended conferences. I talked shop with my trusted peers. I met and spoke with folks within the VCE / Acadia organization. Then I made my move.

Side note: You’d be *amazed* at how effective blaring Peter Gabriel’s “In Your Eyes” from the parking lot under an executive briefing area can be.

[![vAnything](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png "vAnything")](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)One last interesting factoid: As it turns out, I am often updating [CrunchBase](http://crunchbase.com) with new companies I come across in my travels here and there (I’m still the top non-TC contributor as of this blog post btw… *flex*).  One of those bold new ventures I came across was VCE / Acadia.  The competitive leader board side of me realized that there wasn’t an entry for Acadia in Crunchbase. So, I fixed that.

*Why get involved with private cloud now?*

Gartner says…

[![Gartner Says](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png "Gartner Says")](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)*Are you hiring?*

Yes! vSuperheroes in the house! [Acadia is growing](http://acadia.com/careers/index.htm) a number of teams. You’ll want to [start by reviewing this entry from Chad Sakac](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2010/09/more-than-200-open-positions-at-emc-emc-partners-and-vce.html) since it… well, you’ll just have to read it! [Enjoy](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2010/09/more-than-200-open-positions-at-emc-emc-partners-and-vce.html)! There are many ways to contact me but [reach out to me via Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/qthrul) if you see a fit and I will do my best to route you to the right channels. BTW, please be on the lookout for the new [vSpecialist Christmas Album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdSLc68J210&feature=player_embedded) on DVD and Blu-ray!

*Where should Cuthrell Consulting, LLC service provider and infrastructure clients go now?*

I’m still [here](http://cuthrell.com) and now you have a trusted advisor within [Acadia](http://www.acadia.com/). Let’s chat!

*What about the other guest blog and writing you do elsewhere?*

I’m hopeful my time management skills will permit me to reach out on subjects I’m known for writing about beyond fudge.org. I am extremely grateful to the folks at [Telecompetitor](http://telecompetitor.com) and [ReadWriteWeb](http://readwriteweb.com) for giving me amazing platforms and the opportunity to share my views on a wide variety of topics. In short, I hope to continue my contributions as time permits and demand dictates.

*Does this mean fudge.org becomes a corporately controlled blog?*

Nope. I’ll be updating my [disclosure](http://jaycuthrell.com/disclosure/) statement to be less terse and adding some pertinent boilerplate which will make it even more boring. Again, this blog will always be 100% USDA certified Jay Cuthrell aka [@qthrul](http://twitter.com/qthrul). I’ll be writing about things I care about. That won’t ever change. Hey, maybe Friday Fudge will come back into regular circulation again. We shall see.

*Speaking of [@qthrul](http://twitter.com/qthrul)… Does this mean [@qthrul](http://twitter.com/qthrul) on Twitter becomes a corporately controlled Twitter account?*

Nope. I’ll be updating my bio line for [@qthrul](http://twitter.com/qthrul) to reflect pretty much whatever fits into a form element. “I fill out web forms” has served me well so far. Due to the nature of how Twitter functions as a connected API accessible medium, I can only say that my tweets will always be 99.999% USDA certified Jay Cuthrell. One of my favorite replies on Twitter has to be (parphrased) “Jay, I understand about 1 out of every 7 things you tweet”. It’s a good bet my tweets will be as geeky and random as ever. Twitter is a limited engagement medium of course so the longer format of blogs and extraneous append/edit models of Google Buzz are better for protracted discussion.

Thus concludes the F.A.Q. portion of this post.
