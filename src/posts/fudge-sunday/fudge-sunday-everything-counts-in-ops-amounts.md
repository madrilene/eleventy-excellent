This week we take a look at portmanteaus of Development and Operations (DevOps) making inroads toward operationalizing Finance, Data Management, Machine Learning, Communications, and more

Depeche Mode - Everything Counts (Official Video)

 **Getting Informed**

Let’s get started. To begin, here are two tweets for inspiration.

**[Nick DeJesus 🛒🎉 - Unpaid CTO @BTPipeline](https://twitter.com/Dayhaysoos/status/1491814689759797249)**

Developer experience is so much more than using the product itself.  
  
Debugging is part of dev exp.  
  
Documentation is part of dev exp.  
  
Your error messages SHOULD NOT be coming back looking like cryptic metaphors.  
  
I should be able to find what I need in your docs in minutes.

One opportunity I see across the industry is to be more considerate of hidden costs:  
- interviewing  
- developer experience gaps  
- perf  
- ramp up/down  
- internal training  
- process with little outcome/value  
  
The more we account for friction, the more purposeful we can become

Generally speaking, there are a variety of *Something*Ops where *Something* is a variation on the *“Dev”* in *Dev*Ops. Newer entrants are viable as a function of the name, definition, and a reasonably timed gaining of traction in multiple practitioner circles.

There are other examples of *borrowing* from functional groups outside of software development. This borrowing seems to draw from preceding maturity models for established groups as software becomes an increasingly visible component of organizations.

When [FinOps](https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cost_policies/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) meets [DataOps](https://dataopsmanifesto.org/en/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) meets [MLOps](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1247451/worldwide-infrastructure-costs-organizations-third-party/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and becomes expressed as DevX things will get very interesting. Until then, there will likely be additional new phrases being tested and projects that deliver utility at the junctions of different groups or disciplines within organizations.

**[Survey: The State of FinOps 2021](https://data.finops.org/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)**

Assuming that the survey respondents are also concerned with DevX, it’s fascinating roughly *half* have not instituted FinOps automation.

Infracost is just one example of the tools being used to bring a FinOps view to decisions made in the overall DevX.

In 2019, a Google Season of Docs (GSoD) activity workstream for Apache Airflow was completed. Many more such MLOps related documentation endeavors will be required on the journey to infuse MLOps into the DevX.

[airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/blog/experience-in-google-season-of-docs-2019-with-apache-airflow/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Another example? Perhaps the DevX group borrowed the sales and procurement familiar bill of materials (BOM) by placing “S” for software in front ([SBOM](https://harness.io/blog/devops/software-bill-of-materials-sbom/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)). Yet another example is *sales enablement* and now there is *developer enablement*.

That last example, *developer enablement*, makes you think.

What does *good* look like? What does *GREAT* look like?

Well, there’s always a tweet or two that captures the moment…

hey Twitter people!   
  
What are some of your favourite documentation websites? And why do you like them? (features? Design?)

@[bencabanes](https://twitter.com/bencabanes) @[juristr](https://twitter.com/juristr) Firebase, Stripe, Twilio, Apollo GraphQL and MongoDB have pretty good docs.  
  
What I like about them is that they offer functional code samples and demos on how to do XYZ but also bug-free, copy-pastable code snippets.

First – this is amazing teaming/swarming by the team at Twilio Product Management. Second – this is genuine authentic engagement that shows the DevX developer enablement kudos are as earned as the earned media.

Getting to this kind of high NPS public dialog earned media takes cultural and capital investing in the “ables and the ables”

When I referenced “the ibles and the ables” it was to illustrate the steps for getting a great product from ideation to market adoption. As such, product lifecycles capture value through a continuous ruthless removal of annoyance.

* Gaps in the brand pledge are unacceptable.
* A product experience and brand pledge cannot be divergent.
* Any sufficiently advanced product should be indistinguishable from marketing.

Hire. Great. Technical Writers.

Retain. Great. Technical Writers.

Why?

* If your documentation is indexed well, it will be discovered.
* If your documentation is written well, it will be consulted.
* If your documentation is done well, it will be enduring.
