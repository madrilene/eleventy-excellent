Clubhouse is a recent app installation for me. I am more bullish on Twitter Spaces combining Revue for more fully vertical stack.

That said, I saw an interesting Clubhouse popup regarding Enterprise selling and decided to live Quote Tweet it. The results are below the line.

Of course, since this was two different services, the entire newsletter was manually assembled by copying and pasting links to each tweet (and because I wipe my tweets daily). So, imagine how great Revue will be once Twitter fully digests it….

 **Enterprise Selling in a Remote World**

The Clubhouse session was led by a16 partner, David Ulevitch.

**Summary:** Things were weird in 2020. Things are still weird now.

**Details:** What has been learned so far has implications for the future of Enterprise selling. The learnings will apply in a potentially more remote world as well as the possible return to (some percentage of what was) the normal world before 2020.

By the time I joined, I noted that [Deidre Paknad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deidrepaknad/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), CEO & Co-Founder of Workboard, had joined the Clubhouse.

It got Enterprise sales jargon… very fast.

Procurement has entered the room…

Kidding aside, there were some significant moments of “YES!” for me listening as someone fortunate enough to build relationships like the kind mentioned in this Clubhouse.

Contrasting the "ease of access to C-suite" vs. "parking lot" raw story you likely won't get in the remote world call out from @[day\_dree](https://twitter.com/day_dree) <https://t.co/yNK6IX5Yqo>

@[JayCuthrell](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://twitter.com/jaycuthrell) @[day\_dree](https://twitter.com/day_dree) Her surround sound vs 'mono' analogy was incredibly astute.

When the topic moved to “How are you doing revenue wise” you could feel the forecast call vibe on what was truly essential value for business and what was below the value line. Naturally, there was hesitation to forecast accurately with aplomb.

Several references so far on elongated gestation sales cycles commonly experienced vs. annual contract value compression... but... if time to revenue is stretched... same thing? 🤔 <https://t.co/yNK6IX5Yqo>

 [6:32 PM - 10 Jun 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://twitter.com/jaycuthrell/status/1403117988811845634)

Zoom ease of scheduling in a nutshell: Just because you can… doesn’t mean you should.

**[Jay Cuthrell 🤓 ☁️ 🚀](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://twitter.com/jaycuthrell/status/1403118791962337286)**

So many references to missing the "over beers" relationship building vs. Zoom back to back meetings for maximum packing factor. <https://t.co/yNK6IX5Yqo>

 [6:36 PM - 10 Jun 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://twitter.com/jaycuthrell/status/1403118791962337286)

Clearly, the thinking has shifted a bit on what it means to get access to the right folks. However, the definitive close plan was less clear.

We have our first "outside in vs. inside out" reference <https://t.co/yNK6IX5Yqo>

 [6:37 PM - 10 Jun 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://twitter.com/jaycuthrell/status/1403119064336244738)

How do you build trust with someone you’ve never met in person?

**[Jay Cuthrell 🤓 ☁️ 🚀](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://twitter.com/jaycuthrell/status/1403120367007322118)**

The phrase "building rapport" seems to hang on appending "in person". Temporal change for the use of video before COVID vs. after COVID and use of curated video backgrounds vs authentic (messy?). What's the right mix and when in the relationship? <https://t.co/yNK6IX5Yqo>

 [6:42 PM - 10 Jun 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://twitter.com/jaycuthrell/status/1403120367007322118)

Zoom, regrettably, has become a verb. When used as a noun, the connotations varied.

**[Jay Cuthrell 🤓 ☁️ 🚀](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://twitter.com/jaycuthrell/status/1403122193639292929)**

Zoom is not "deep substantive engagement" -- @[day\_dree](https://twitter.com/day_dree)   
  
Zoom is performative -- @[OlegR](https://twitter.com/OlegR)   
  
Zoom puts some at a disadvantage -- @[borisjabes](https://twitter.com/borisjabes)   
  
Zoom is about digital competency -- @[digitalrowland](https://twitter.com/digitalrowland) <https://t.co/yNK6IX5Yqo>

As someone working remotely since 2009-ish, this resonated. I found a picture of my old office in 2009 and while it was very nice it was a lifetime ago.

Call out to fully remote (pre COVID) companies that used off sites, trips, trade shows, and other purposeful get togethers in lieu of coming to HQ or central offices to build up the human to human bonds that traditional companies with a culture built on real estate leasing. <https://t.co/yNK6IX5Yqo>

Most of innovative companies I’ve been pitched in the past few months have been using Loom. It’s good stuff.

Exemplar pattern called out: @[loom](https://twitter.com/loom)  
  
Using @[loom](https://twitter.com/loom) as a basis for async proposals and discussion for what @[day\_dree](https://twitter.com/day_dree) calls "doses of value" 🤯 <https://t.co/yNK6IX5Yqo>

This marked the close of the conversation and it wasn’t clear if there would be a recording or transcription posted at the end of the event. But… watch this tweet for updates:
