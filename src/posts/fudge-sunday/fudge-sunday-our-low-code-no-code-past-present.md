This week we take a quick look at the past, present, and future of Low Code No Code + Developer Evangelism Relations Advocacy. Buckle up for a ride!

 **Getting Informed**

I'm sensing a trend! Now if we can just all agree on spelling...

 **Low Code and No Code spelling variations**

Software applications (apps) are typically created by software application developers. So, if we are to live in a world where “there is an app for everything” then it will take a lot more software application developers.

Or, creating apps will need to require fewer software application developers over time. Software application developers write code, so perhaps a way to require fewer software application developers is to consider less code, lowered amounts of code, or no code at all.

Creating apps for everything even if you aren’t a software application developer sounds like it might be a very big deal one day. Gee… If only there was a way to explain this *less code required* concept with an inconsistently spelled new terminology?

Good news!

If you’ve heard of *low code, low/code, low-code or no code, no/code, no-code* then you’ve experienced a neologism that can’t decide how it should be spelled. Don’t worry though, Gartner says that by next year more companies than not will be using Low Code in pursuit of productivity gains from their largest employment ranks — ***people that are not developers**.*

*[yes, that’s ( — ) an em dash](https://twitter.com/yayalexisgay/status/1465776683819094018?s=20&utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)*

Four years ago, Gartner published Enterprise High-Productivity Application (EHPA) reports. EHPA had a magic quadrant with three (3) companies in the “Leaders” quadrant such as Salesforce, OutSystems, and Mendix.

Three years ago, [OutSystems took ~$350M in funding](https://www.techmeme.com/180605/p11?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a180605p11) and a few months later [Mendix was acquired for ~$700M by Siemens](https://www.techmeme.com/180801/p22?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a180801p22).

Two years ago, Gartner began publishing Low Code Application Platform (aka LCAP) reports. LCAP has a magic quadrant now too.

Most recently in 2021, Gartner has added more LCAP “Leaders”. Joining Mendix, Salesforce, and OutSystems are a rapidly ascending ServiceNow and Microsoft.

In short, LCAP is a fast growing market to help companies empower people that are not developers. So, what does that mean for the companies that have been investing heavily in… Developer Evangelism, Developer Relations, and Developer Advocacy?

Let’s think about that next.

 **Developer Evangelism Relations Advocacy**

When I think of Developer Evangelism, I think of [1990s era sweat dripping executives on stage remixed with industrial house dub sensibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=KMU0tzLwhbE). Maybe that’s just me though but evangelism has more of a direct selling connotation that goes for land and expand goals vs. adoption of a platform through the Marketing organization.

When I think of Developer Relations, I think of the companies that seek to enable adoption of a platform. Fundamentally, the goal is to align to the success of the developers through the Sales organization.

When I think of Developer Advocacy, I think of the individuals that are organized for maximum impact by leaders in Developer Relations. As such, the Developer Advocacy function is a resource to Sales that is focused exclusively on the success of the developers using the platform.

Let’s circle back though to the Low Code topic we started with earlier.

* How do you widen the aperture of access to the ways of developers?
* How do you reach those that are not developers?
* Will courses help for those that are not developers?

[@film\_girl](https://twitter.com/film_girl/status/1466567201125650432)

Would anyone be interested in a course about version control, GitHub, and Markdown for non-developers?

🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

If you’ve ever followed @film\_girl then you know she is usually far far ahead of the curve. So, *seeing a call out to **non-developers** is definitely something to pay attention to and think about more.*

Now we’re going to get back to the Low Code and No Code…

How did we get here?

Let’s look back a decade or so then look forward.

 **2015**

By 2015, you might recall the STEM movement was in high gear. While not all STEM leads to the creation of professional software developers, the decide to widen the aperture of access to software development was already well underway as the “the creator economy” of 50 million people sought greater access to productivity tools.

 **Past, Present, and Future: DevOps**

At this point, you might ask *“Wait, does this mean DevOps succeeded?”*

Well, sort of.

* The goal is to solve business problems with rapid app development via Low Code.
* Low code is only made possible by developers and operations enabling and empowering a far greater audience.
* The audience is people that are not developers.

First, consider the past and present of DevOps culture as captured in this video from GitHub featuring [DevOps For Dummies author Emily Freeman](https://g.co/kgs/Kw8WDW?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

(If you haven’t heard of Emily before, she is a Java backend engineer that channeled her developer experiences with pager weary operations teams into informative conference talks, educational articles, [and a book](https://g.co/kgs/Kw8WDW?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)!)

Next, consider the future of DevOps culture to expressed as follows:

***Empower and enable users to build apps for everything via Low Code***

Will that DevOps future be realized?

Place your bets.
