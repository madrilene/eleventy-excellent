# Getting Informed

[Bookmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmark_(digital)) (or Favorites or Stars) are still a popular way to remember websites without reliance upon search engines that periodically gave rise to social-bookmarking sites. In fact, stars icons even made it to more niche social sites such as GitHub where you can sort by the number of bookmarks (favorites) in the form of stars.

I bookmark many things... but usually in a browser vs. a social-bookmarking site. Lately, I've become more clippings oriented as I drive more workflow into Obsidian.

Now it's time for reading 📖, listening 🎧, and watching 📺 suggestions:

- First, [📖 How Spotify Achieved a Voluntary 99% Internal Platform Adoption Rate](https://thenewstack.io/how-spotify-achieved-a-voluntary-99-internal-platform-adoption-rate/) in which [Jennifer Riggins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkriggins/) interviews [Helen Greul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenagreul/) on convincing developers in deep water rapids of software delivery that being inside the [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/) boat is in their best interest and how to fashion or grab inner-source paddles.
- Second, [🎧 Hybrid Cloud Revolution](https://www.cables2clouds.com/2129055/13452838-ep-15-hybrid-cloud-revolution-with-azure-mvp-karl-cooke?t=0) in which [Tim McConnaughy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmcconnaughy), [Christopher Miles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherleemiles), and [Alex Perkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-perkins) interview [Karl Cooke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlcooke) then bring a network engineer perspective to both cloud networking as well as managed k8s with a plug for [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-arc).
- Third, [📺 Breaking Analysis: Cloud security and Gen AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHK2Cz2xZ40) in which [David Vellante](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvellante/) unpacks data from [ETR](https://etr.ai) and conveys a story for how natural language interface tooling may provide much needed human machine augmentation partnerships that also address the thousands of unfilled security practitioner roles across industries.

## I've seen them fall, fast and steady 🎶

It's been almost five (5!) years since the social-bookmarking site, Del.icio.us, was shut down after being acquired by another social-bookmarking site, Pinboard.

## But I keep falling when I'm higher 🎶

Two (2!) years have gone by since I first fell down the rabbit hole with [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com).

As I've mentioned before, I tend to use Safari Bookmark or Reading List with every intention of going back and... it happens sometimes. Yet, even flirting with reader aggregation oriented apps, I still find myself abandoning the technique for more portable alternatives.

Over the next few issues of this newsletter there will be a formatting change. 

- After 100 songs it reached, I will drop the inclusion of Spotify play list updates
- Work Plug section will be removed entirely next week (unless there is something I want to share) which should give me back 45 words for the 500-1000 words that readers tolerate 🤣
- Workflow will be increasingly driven around Obsidian and automation
- Embedded rich cards for URLs will likely shift from mikrolink (thank you!) to an alternative
- I'll try to wrap up all of these and any other changes in time for a Zettelkasten end of year for 2023

So, what will be the next big thing in bookmarking services?

Until then… Place your bets!
