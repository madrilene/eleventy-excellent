Getting Informed
================

I’ve been deeply immersed in multicloud pursuits for 566 days[2](#footnote-2) and by gathering facts, I developed a few opinions. I now believe that in a few more years, multicloud becomes popularized, supercloud becomes revivified, and ubiquitous workload substrate becomes a reality.

First, let’s see where trends peaked as topics. For the trend of supercloud, we revisit the “Supercloud” related work out of Cornell circa 2015-2016.[3](#footnote-3)

Next, let’s get a quote from [Dave Vellante](https://wikibon.com/author/david-vellante/), Chief Analyst at The Wikibon Project who published a [“Rise of the Supercloud”](https://wikibon.com/breaking-analysis-rise-supercloud/) post that was jam packed with compelling charts and strong opinions in late 2021 (**emphasis mine**).


> ***Supercloud** is an architecture that **taps the underlying services & primitives** **of hyperscale clouds** **to deliver additional value above and beyond** what's available from the public cloud provider. A supercloud delivers capabilities through software, consumed as services; **and can** run on a single hyperscale cloud or **span multiple clouds**.*[4](#footnote-4)

### Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen 🎶

At present, there are a few facts that come to mind on what is happening and what is going to happen.

* GCP is expanding region coverage to places like Dallas TX USA.[5](#footnote-5)
* Azure is expanding region coverage to places like Doha Qatar.[6](#footnote-6)
* AWS Local Zones and Outpost availability is expanding to places like Panama.[7](#footnote-7)
* 29% CAGR for public cloud revenue puts a path to ~$1T revenue in perspective.[8](#footnote-8)
* Companies like Observe build on Snowflake which builds on public clouds.[9](#footnote-9)
* And a contrarian point… 🤔 guy that shorted  has a new thesis.[10](#footnote-10)

Also, there are many places that are population centers and [where things are made](https://sunday.fudge.org/p/make-iiot-easy-on-yourself). So, supercloud could make sense for workloads that take advantage of access of eventual ubiquity and leverage the new digital highways (5G) being built as well.

Keith Townsend @CTOAdvisorIs VMware in the pole position to provide #SuperCloud via Cross-Cloud Services, or is this a job better suited for @HashiCorp?

Looking back, 20 years have passed since I last attended HP related technology conferences. But last week, I was fortunate to attend HPE Discover in the times of multicloud and supercloud almost 12+ years after I first wrote about ubiquitous workload substrate when I joined Acadia/VCE.

So, finally, please enjoy this [quick 60 second video clip from HPE Discover via theCube](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxuqz4mHpv77X7LEXAuKgoE8ppQyWiUJsU) where Dave Vellante’s supercloud meets Antonio Neri’s substrate! 

Place your bets!
