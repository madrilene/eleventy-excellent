Next month I’ll reach my 3 year mark with VCE.

The VCE rocketship has only continued to [accelerate](http://www.vce.com/accelerate) since I jumped on board. I’m consistently amazed at what VCE has been able to accomplish in this short amount of time. There is still much work to do but I am happy and fortunate to be part of the team.

The vision from 2010 is the reality of 2013. Ubiquitous workload substrate and an everything just works data center world are not so much a destination but an ever advancing goal. Here’s to the vision of 2014 and beyond. Combinatorial optimization FTW!!!

To that end, VCE is launching the next generation of market leading true converged infrastructure solutions on [September 17, 2013](http://www.vce.com/accelerate).

More, more, more
================

In the more category I am spending even more time in VCE Customer meetings with VCE Partners lately. This is on top of increased VCE cross functional team velocity. That means conversations with lots and lots of new VCE Customers and returning to meet with repeat VCE Customers.

Since my last [timely](http://fudge.org/archive/a-timely-question/) post a few things have been consuming my time away from this blog.

* drumming up interest for my SxSW panel submission [A Wheel Of Pain: How I Learned To Love Enterprise](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/18104)
* there are a few [more places](http://thebackupwindow.emc.com/author/jay_cuthrell/) I’ve been [publishing](https://blog.vce.com/author/jay-cuthrell/)
* spending quality time with [analysts](https://blog.vce.com/trends/vce-perspectives-gartner-catalyst-2013/)
* [whiteboard sessions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YddLdU6q9io) with really smart folks
* random [fun stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFg7EQao79o) :wink:

Survey says: Buy a Vblock
=========================

What has been really great is seeing the wider audience of pundits, analysts, and the market realize that Vblock Systems from VCE are about accelerating the transformation that is taking place in the data center. In short — buy a Vblock.

Here is a sample of what I mean in their own words:

Okay. Per my usual blogging style around here, below are a few helpful instructional videos I’ve collected from my recent months on the road :wink:
