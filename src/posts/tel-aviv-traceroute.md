Greetings from Tel Aviv. My body says it is noon. Everyone else here says it is 7 hours later.

The flight sucked so much it isn’t funny. First, all my connects are late, then I get to the ticketing counter and they tell me they are overbooked and since I am late to check in they gave away my seat.

I did much protesting and turned on the charm. Okay, so I asked a manager for help, many many many hours later I am off the ground at JFK (delays) and headed to Tel Aviv. Boy, that trans atlantic food just gets better and better every time.

I have taken pics with my old camera since I couldn’t bear losing the Nikon to random mishap. My room is facing the sea. The sunset tonight was simply gorgeous. This place reminds me so much of Huntington Beach. The only difference is that everyone talks Hebrew and the buildings look like post-shell shock era.

Oh, I am doing this from a magic port in the hotel room of another person here with me in the same hotel. I say magic because you dial out and it just ”*knows*”. You don’t change any settings for your regular dialup. Freaky. Here is the back to my home page:
