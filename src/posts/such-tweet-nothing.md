Happy New Year! I am not one for resolutions, but I'm inspired [^0] to keep Fudge Sunday issues to just under 500 words this year.

# Getting Informed

This week we take a look at IndieWeb origins and ActivityPub within the fediverse, and other options outside of the Tweet place. As the fediverse will turn fifteen (15!) years old soon, it is a good time to [look back](https://web.archive.org/web/20130615111045/http://identi.ca/notice/1) and look ahead.

## Emptied out by a single word 🎶

Back in 2009, I considered [^1] the implications of how companies like Facebook were handling use generated content as a social media company. Meanwhile, others were [seeing destructive patterns](https://indieweb.org/history) in social media companies. 

Arguably, it was a series of [site-deaths](https://indieweb.org/site-deaths) that raised concerns that led to action and organization. Nearly a decade ago, talks were given around the time of inception of IndieWeb concepts being put forward.



Later this month, ActivityPub will turn five (5!) years old.[^2] 

Today, if you visit [IndieWeb.org](https://indieweb.org) -- it still very much exists. Indeed, there is every indication in the past few years that [site-deaths](https://indieweb.org/site-deaths) will change the perceptions of growing numbers of the online community that seek decentralized alternatives.

## It isn't easy for me to let it go 🎶

Recently, you're probably hearing more about online services that are embracing ActivityPub. But there is more than only [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon). 

For example last year, [Akkoma](https://akkoma.social) came to represent [an interesting fork](https://coffee-and-dreams.uk/development/2022/06/24/akkoma.html) in prior fediverse projects.

As another example of what's old becoming what's new, I liked [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B) and the notion of their circles until Google shut it down a few years later. Luckily, the folks behind [Bonfire](https://bonfirenetworks.org/posts/introducing\_boundaries/) are, perhaps, getting the band back together.

Also, the long lived [diaspora](https://blog.diasporafoundation.org/74-diaspora-s-10-years-in-community-hands) recently celebrated just over ten (10!) years of community contributions and has reached [v0.7.18.1](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/releases/tag/v0.7.18.1). Perhaps it too will embrace ActivityPub one day within the larger [Fediverse Party](https://fediverse.party).

If you have been online for longer than a few years you are more likely to have seen consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, etc. for a particular online service you might have used or even enjoyed using — and now you miss it to some degree. Indeed, the longer the participate in any endeavor, market, or game the higher the probability for different outcomes you might witness.

So, what will be the next major social media company or beloved online service to append to the growing list of [site-deaths](https://indieweb.org/site-deaths)?

Until then... Place your bets!
