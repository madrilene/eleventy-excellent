In perhaps the last in a series of such posts, the traditional one year blog post continues. The year since my last work related update would best be described as several doors closing and several doors opening.

TLDR
====

I have some news to share from last month.

*TLDR — Yesterday was my last day at Dell Technologies. [Let’s catch up soon](https://calendly.com/jaycuthrell/call).*

*Details — For 9 years and 11 months, I was incredibly privileged to serve a truly amazing global team of professionals. Together, we made vision into a reality by shifting the paradigm of how IT is delivered to enable digital transformation for our customers.*

*[Let’s catch up on a Zoom or a Google Meet soon](https://calendly.com/jaycuthrell/call). If there is anything I can do to help you in any way, please do not hesitate to reach out and chat over a beverage virtually.*

Yep. I’m no longer with Dell Technologies.

I shared this update on LinkedIn a few weeks ago. Since then I’ve been catching up with past team members that continue the mission of digital transformation as well as peers and colleagues around the globe.

Free time has meant a few road trips, time spent looking out at the ocean, and I hope to see mountains soon as Fall colors arrive. So far I’ve almost finished reading one of the books recommended to me and I’ve got a few more on the way.

The Years in Review
===================

Speaking of free time…

I have some time now to clean up more blog content from over the years. That should be fun reading, editing, and getting my workflow setup for rebooting my blog for the umpteenth time. :smile:

To that end, here are all ten (10) of my yearly updates starting with Acadia to VCE to EMC to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies.

* 2010 [Year 0 at Acadia](https://fudge.org/archive/private-clouds-ahead)
* 2011 [Year 1 at VCE, formerly known as Acadia](https://fudge.org/archive/my-first-year-at-vce)
* 2012 [Year 2 at VCE](https://fudge.org/archive/my-second-year-at-vce)
* 2013 [Year 3 at VCE](https://fudge.org/archive/my-third-year-at-vce)
* 2014 [Year 4 at VCE](https://fudge.org/archive/my-fourth-year-at-vce)

* 2016 [Year 6 at VCE, a Dell EMC Company](https://fudge.org/archive/my-sixth-year-at-vce)
* 2017 [Year 7 at VCE, a Dell EMC Company](https://fudge.org/archive/my-seventh-year-at-vce)

==========

As readers of my yearly updates over the years might expect, I’ve rarely blogged about what I did at Acadia, VCE, EMC, Dell EMC, and Dell Technologies (or VMware, Cisco, Intel, etc.). No, this doesn’t change now that I’m no longer with Dell Technologies. :smile:

That said, if you have 20 minutes to share, you can listen to a podcast I was fortunate to record earlier this year with the fine folks over at the [AI in Action podcast](https://alldus.com/blog/podcasts/aiinaction-jay-cuthrell-dell-technologies/). I go into a very light amount of detail about the team members I was so incredibly lucky to serve in my time at Dell Technologies over the past few years.

Our podcast discussion was centered on the artificial intelligence / machine learning / deep learning / active learning space and the talents required for the next industrial revolution that will interact with data from the physical world around us. I look forward to reading future updates from my former team members as they continue the hard but neccesary work at the intersection of technology and human progress.

In addition, during our podcast discussion there are several shout outs to just some of Dell Technologies groups that I was privileged to work with as well as [just some of the amazing companies](https://www.delltechnologiescapital.com/portfolio/) funded by the incredibly smart folks within [Dell Technologies Capital](https://www.delltechnologiescapital.com/team/). The future is bright.

One Last Thing
==============

For the past several years, I’ve been heads down in product management, product (guerrilla) marketing, software engineering, field planning, competitive research, analyst relations, field CTO engagements, customer engineering, pre-sales, operations, and leading teams but also wondering what my next career adventure will be.

Looking ahead, I am going to be taking my own advice from the [thinking remotely](https://fudge.org/archive/thinking-remotely) post I published last month. I’m a former CTO/VP/GM with a telecom infrastructure background that somehow stumbled into the business of cloud computing. So, for me, the future of 5G / Telco / Edge / BMaaS / etc. looks like a bright shining beacon on the near horizon.

Why? The cloud will be coming to the physical work faster than we may realize. Just imagine being able to be present for another paradigm shift in ones lifetime.

**Do you have any suggestions for what I should consider for my next career adventure?**

If you have suggestions (*or just want to catch up*), please [grab some time on my calendar](https://calendly.com/jaycuthrell/call) and [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaycuthrell) or [contact me here](https://jaycuthrell.com/contact/).

Be safe and be well. :smile:
