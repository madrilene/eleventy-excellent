This week we take a look at platform engineering related venture capital (VC) funding you might have missed.

# Getting Informed

Depending on your historical sources, if the public cloud was a person, it would arguably still be [a teenager](https://web.archive.org/web/20060818023744/http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=3435361). So, just as some might argue public cloud is like renting someone else's computer it is worth noting the plucky young public cloud cannot drive (let alone rent!) a motorized rental vehicle in the United States.

[![us-state-min-car-rental-age.jpeg](https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/a8ff0203-2f85-4f2b-9d54-481b8e450c1b.jpeg)](https://www.rhinocarhire.com/Drive-Smart-Blog/Minimum-Driving-Age-Country/Minimum-Driving-Age-State.aspx)

Public cloud could legally drive a car in all 50 states within the United States but would have to buy/borrow it — leasing won't be an option for at least another year. However, the auto insurance is probably pretty expensive either way.

Then again, back when public cloud was just a toddler, there were no Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) either. Even as a teenager that means AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI will just have call an Uber or Lyft for the next few years.

Dry those [fasb.org](https://fasb.org/document/blob?fileName=ASU%202018-15.pdf) tears.

## I'll be more together 🎶

In our [last issue](https://fudge.org/archive/quaterly-roundup-edition/), we summarized VC funding news as well as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) for the first three months of 2023. Quarterly round up format may make an appearance again, but it is time for a second pass from last month.

Indeed, as soon as the submit button was pressed... one more funding event came into focus. Let's take a closer look at a recent investment in a company helping to simplify and streamline adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) associated with public cloud operating models.

Looking back at prior issues of Fudge Sunday there are a few [IaC trends](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-sunday-peek-a-boo) from this time last year. Also, just before the new year, I once again posted about [IaC trends](https://fudge.org/archive/proxy-tear-us-apart/).

And now, as of late last month...

## Thoughts that leave me 🎶

You might be asking... what is [env0](https://www.env0.com/why-env0)? When in doubt, always ask a sales engineer. 

In this case, ask [KMac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kdamaso).

Perhaps you've wondered out loud about ChatOps or GitOps and wanted to see an example. Well, [env0 has a fun example](https://docs.env0.com/docs/plan-and-apply-from-pr-comments).

Perhaps you also wondered out loud if IaC could get expensive as mentioned [last year in Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-sunday-everything-counts-in-ops-amounts). Again, [env0 has heard you](https://docs.env0.com/docs/cost-monitoring).

\_[ Jay brings back the teenager public cloud again ]\_

Seeing investments in companies that bring convergence thinking and greater abstraction to IaC is both a healthy signal and a sobering reminder that cloud computing won't be a teenager much longer. 

Of course, with the rise of TNCs, the rental car market might not be as vibrant as it once was by the time public cloud reaches the right age — and perhaps that is a cautionary tale in itself. Ultimately, cloud is an operating model not a locale — and commensurate allocation is the goal.

Perhaps there will be different rental horses for different rental courses. Perhaps the convergence is just beginning.

So, what will be the next big thing in IaC tooling related VC funding?

Until then… Place your bets!
