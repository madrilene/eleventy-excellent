This is Edition 7 of my [newest](/topics/fudge-factor) newsletter on our [increasingly connected](/archive/increasingly-connected) world.

### 🔮 Updates from the future

I'll soon be looking back on my 30/60/90 day[^work] plan.

I upgraded to the latest Eleventy Excellent [^11ty] over the holiday and have more edits planned to back port my deeper customizations.

In addition, I reached the defaults limit of Netlify and ended up adding an option for build [^netlify] to get around errors. Going forward, I'll be focusing on build time optimization and possibly shifting from my current build stack to other alternatives.

I'll also be updating my automation [^activepieces] and updating newsletter [^buttondown] functionality.

### 🗓️ Events

Tis the season... for... Las Vegas?

While I won't be attending AWS re:Invent[^reinvent] December 2 – 6, 2024 — my peers [^nexustek] will be. Let me know [^email] if you'd like to connect with them onsite or offsite.

Instead, I will be attending Gartner IT Infrastructure, Operations & Cloud Strategies Conference[^gartner] December 9-12, 2024. Again, let me know [^book] if you'd like to connect with us onsite or offsite.

> At just under 300 words and a few footnotes, that's all for this month. 🤓
