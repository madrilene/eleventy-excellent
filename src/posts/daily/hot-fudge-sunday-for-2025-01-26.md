## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-01-22
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-01-23
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->One headline for a Thursday Throwback caught my eye. Specifically, the claim of ~5.6 Tbps of traffic during the peak of _one_ DDoS attack.

https://www.techmeme.com/250122/p10#a250122p10

For perspective, in 2013 there was _one_ DDoS attack that "almost broke the Internet" which was claimed to be ~0.085 Tbps of traffic.

https://www.techmeme.com/130327/p29#a130327p29

My point is, the comparisons are quite a bit different. The mitigation techniques and expansion of the Cloudflare business has likely changed.
