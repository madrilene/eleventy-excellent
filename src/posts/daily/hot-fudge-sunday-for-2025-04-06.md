## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). I have participated in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) for a year since leaving IBM, rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting), and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).

Since late last year, I’ve been highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. I strongly encouraged my readers to view the LinkedIn profiles of these professionals, connect, and reach out to them.

Week over week, the list grew until I had to add an Alumni 🎉 section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.

## 📈 Markets Monday for 2025-03-31

As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…

<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3>

For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.

Last week:

<figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/555dae30-00c5-4514-891b-a7d79a8336db.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Spicy Level 23!" draggable="false"><figcaption>Spicy Level 23!</figcaption></figure>

This week:

<figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7f2ff0ed-b915-4f1e-b32c-bd3e4ae57823.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Not so spicy returns" draggable="false"><figcaption>Not so spicy returns</figcaption></figure>

Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies when the market is moving and a smaller handful of companies when the market is not moving as much.

If you are using [Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/research-hub/screener/) screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.

- % Change in Price (Intraday):**greater than 4**
- Region: **United States**
- Market Cap (Intraday): **Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap**
- Price (Intraday):**greater than or equal 5**
- Volume:**greater than 15000**
- Sector: **Technology**
- Industry: **Software—Infrastructure and Information Technology Services and Computer Hardware and Software—Application and Communication Equipment and Electronics & Computer Distribution and Consumer Electronics and Electronic Components and Scientific & Technical Instruments and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials and Semiconductors**

## 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2025-04-01

(Yes, I’m avoiding [things today would be known for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ZoHvf63OM).)

Two hot takes on funding on Tuesday.

🤖 + 💰 Learn to code they said… well. Yes, still learn.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250401/p43#a250401p43](https://www.techmeme.com/250401/p43#a250401p43)

🤖 + 💰 Robots won’t take jobs… oh wait. Scratch that.

## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-04-02

Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-04-03

One headline for Thursday Throwback caught my eye.

🤝 + 🍪 If you can’t beat or buy em… try a joint-venture.

2025

[https://www.techmeme.com/250403/p27#a250403p27](https://www.techmeme.com/250403/p27#a250403p27)

[https://www.techmeme.com/240604/p37#a240604p37](https://www.techmeme.com/240604/p37#a240604p37)

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-04-04

The story that caught my eye this week was not the stock market and tariffs… it was silicon photonics.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250401/p16#a250401p16](https://www.techmeme.com/250401/p16#a250401p16)

Assume every cloud service provider is simultaneously buying every GPU they can while also accelerating their own custom silicon production. This buys time for what comes next.

What comes next are the innovations in silicon photonics that will fundamentally alter these current assumptions.

Silicon photonics will change existing AI workload architectural designs that would not otherwise be able to satisfy exponential growth in AI workloads in the years to come — silicon photonics is what’s needed next.

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-04-05

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.

#### Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
