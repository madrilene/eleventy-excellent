### 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2024-09-11
 
Each Wednesday I go through dozens of Slack communities.

I then select the most interesting shared links.

This will always be a safe for work list. 🙈

### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-09-12
 
Telecom and the .com boom (and bust) days were part of [my early career](https://fudge.org/archive/and-for-my-next-trick/). 25 years ago, I was able to participate in an early approximation of a “cloud” by Intel that was called an Application Service Provider (ASP).

Yes. Intel.

In late 1999, [Intel got into the web hosting business](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/1999/CN092899.htm) by launching Intel Online Services (IOS).

See if this part sounds familiar:

> **Second-Generation Hosting**  
> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Intel Online Services' main focus is its second-generation hosting, in which standard, hardware and software is integrated, validated, and managed by Intel Online Services. Using this approach, Intel Online Services provides not just the building, power and network connection - called co-location hosting - but also the servers, operating system software and basic applications. By providing and managing this second-generation hardware and software platform, Intel Online Services can offer a higher degree of predictability and reliability. This can also reduce the cost for customers, since they don't have to hire IT staffs, buy computers, configure software, or carry out other costly tasks. Intel Online Services, Inc., is an Intel subsidiary that intends to be a leading supplier of hosted Internet services, business applications, and e-Commerce services worldwide.</span>

Source: [Intel News Release, 2000](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/in040400.htm)

By 2000, IOS announced it would allocate $1B to bring [10 Internet Data Centers (IDCs)](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/in040400.htm) online.

By early 2002, IOS had signed customers with iconic brands such as Sony, eBay, BP, Tour de France, EMI, MSN, American Stock Exchange, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, BBC, </span> <span>and others with partners like EMC that provided technology for hosting “</span>[multiple terabytes of storage](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/cn112700.htm)<span>” that seem rather quaint today but was bleeding edge a quarter century ago.</span>

However, life moves fast and so did the .com boom. By late 2002, [IOS was no more](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2002/20020618corp.htm).

Of course “cloud” became wildly successful. Even conservative projections easily cross over into the trillions ($T) for the “cloud” market.

Today, A.I. is taking up a lot of the conversations about “cloud”.

Lately, Intel has apparently been finding what else to shed.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-09-13
 
As of this update, my delegate duties at [AI Field Day 5](https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/) for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/) are done but my notes will be published in the coming days / weeks. Over three days, I and fellow delegates took in updates from Keysight, Integrail, Cisco, VMware, Elastic, Arista, and Enfabrica *as well as* a Delegate Ignite Talk series and Delegate Roundtable!

<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>I would like to give a HUGE shout out to the team that makes Tech Field Day possible and to Futurum Group as well the sponsoring companies for making the event possible. 🙏 🙏 🙏</p></blockquote>

What’s next?

1.  [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) in Portland October 1-4, 2024
2.  [Cloud Field Day 21](https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/) in Silicon Valley October 23-25, 2024 for [Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/events/)
3.  [All Things Open](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/) in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for [CLS](https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2)

Once again, I am thankful for [new and ongoing client work](https://cuthrell.consulting/services/), meeting folks in person that I’d previously only known online, and catching up with past co-workers. While gym and hiking continues, my list of non-technology projects took a break this week due being on the road.

As I indicated, AI Field Day was a lot to take in this week. I’ll share more once I’ve consolidated my notes.

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-09-14
 
By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.

#### Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
