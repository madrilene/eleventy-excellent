I hosted <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://lu.ma/y073h3oa">an event</a> this morning too.</p><p>Regular readers know I normally work out of The Vault in Beaufort, NC USA. While the parking is not free, the view is legit and weather was nice <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://lu.ma/y073h3oa">this morning</a>.</p><p>In fact, I’m considering making this event a weekly occurrence. I’ve already created the event for next week.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://lu.ma/7d2bcsvg"><span style="color: rgb(19, 21, 23)">https://lu.ma/7d2bcsvg</span></a></p><p>This week, I also published a full week of “Free Preview” posts for Hot Fudge Daily on Fudge Sunday.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org/archive/hot-fudge-daily-digest/">https://fudge.org/archive/hot-fudge-daily-digest/</a></p><p>Again, I’ll likely collapse <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://fudge.org">fudge.org</a> content that is exclusively newsletter content into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://hot.fudge.org">hot.fudge.org</a> for ONLY newsletters and reclaim <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://fudge.org">fudge.org</a> as a blogging platform. We shall see.</p><p>For Hot Fudge Daily, I changed to a $9.99 yearly subscription since Stripe taking 1/3 of $0.99 monthly revenue in the prior fee structure. 🤯🧐💸</p><ol class="footnotes"></ol>
