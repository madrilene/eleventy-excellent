## 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2025-06-03

💰 + 🤯 There are the prevailing PE narratives… and then is PE that operates on another level of reality.

## 🤪 Wacky Wednesday for 2025-06-04

Each Wednesday I then select the most interesting shared link from dozens of Slack communities. This will always be a safe for work link. 🙈

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-06-05

🤖 + 🧫 One story caught my eye this week was Cortical Labs announcing the shipping of their biological computer this summer.

[https://www.techmeme.com/250604/p7#a250604p7](https://www.techmeme.com/250604/p7#a250604p7)

For perspective, organoid computing and organoid intelligence running atop biological operating system… (BIOs — get it?) has been getting [more coverage](https://newatlas.com/computers/finalspark-bio-computers-brain-organoids/) lately.

Back in 2009, even Intel was describing [our biological computing future](https://www.techmeme.com/090209/p70#a090209p70).

During the 1970s, if you watched the TV series, Tomorrow People, then you might remember their biotic computer, [TIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tomorrow_People#Cast).

 

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-06-06

🤖 + 🚁 The story that caught my eye this week was the expansion of drone delivery in <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa.</span>

[https://www.techmeme.com/250605/p41#a250605p41](https://www.techmeme.com/250605/p41#a250605p41)

To understand the impact of this expansion, consider the speed in which is has arrived in less than 10 years.

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-06-07

Ah, the Friday news dump. By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.

### Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀

Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

🤔 🤨 🧐 Just a couple that caught my technologist eye…
