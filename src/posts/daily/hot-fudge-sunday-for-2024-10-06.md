### 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-10-03
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>21 years ago, WordPress was released and would go on to power hundreds of millions of websites. In fact, WordPress powered my own blog(s) and personal websites for many years before I migrated to headless CMS alternatives.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress</a></p><p>In the years since, WordPress usage has grown considerably as has <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Automattic, the company behind </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://WordPress.com"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">WordPress.com</span></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"> and other related companies offering WordPress services</span>.

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-10-04
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Travel changes this week mean I am still updating my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/">AI Field Day 5</a> delegate notes that sit in my drafts pile to be published. Due to the travel changes, I also missed out on Monktoberfest (again!) but I am thankful for the amazing organizers that helped me find a way to give back in my absence.</p><p>Two big numbers stories that caught me eye this week:</p><ul><li><p>For perspective, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14">3.8 Tbps</a> is Terabits per second per second (i.e. trillions)… and is equivalent of fully saturating a 32 port 100G Ethernet LAN switch with traffic… and then adding even more traffic on top… but now, imagine that traffic flowing over the Internet to one place every second. My math might be off but that’s like sending two dozen compressed text copies of Wikipedia… every second… or if you double-side printed the compressed text copies of Wikipedia as wartime payload… that would be like three Iowa-class battleships firing those Wikipedias —&nbsp;every second. 🤯</p></li><li><p>I’ve written about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://hot.fudge.org/archive/?q=poolside">Poolside</a> before and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26">$500M is a staggering Series B raise</a> for the very precise focus their leadership has shared publicly. 🤯</p></li></ul><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26">https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26</a></p><p></p>

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-10-05
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p><h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><p>In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.</p><h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p15#a241004p15">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p15#a241004p15</a></p><h4>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p19#a241004p19">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p19#a241004p19</a></p><h4>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p4#a241004p4">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p4#a241004p4</a></p><h4>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p2#a241004p2">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p2#a241004p2</a></p><h4>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p17#a241004p17">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p17#a241004p17</a></p>
