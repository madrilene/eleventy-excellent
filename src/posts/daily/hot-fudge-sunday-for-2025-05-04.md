## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). Previously, I participated in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) for a year after leaving IBM, rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting), and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).

Since late last year, I’ve also been highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. This week I’m simplifying as the About section updates were not getting updated (by me) in a timely fashion.

Week over week, the list grew until I had to add an Alumni 🎉 section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>As a reminder, this is an end of day snapshot…</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Quick Recap</h3><p>For Market Monday, I continue to look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things through the lens of the closing bell on Monday.</p><p>Last week:</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ef06e8db-9d7a-4467-8790-c7e2ee134417.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="No spicy (2 weeks in a row)" draggable="false"><figcaption>No spicy (2 weeks in a row)</figcaption></figure><p>This week:</p><figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/2373503a-3131-4654-9383-a27635f79493.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Return of spicy level 1!" draggable="false"><figcaption>Return of spicy level 1!</figcaption></figure><p>Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance.

## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-05-02
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->🔐 + 🔮 The story that caught my eye this week was the move by Microsoft to accelerate the embrace of passkeys.

https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p7#a250502p7

For context, I've written about this topic before... but it was back in September 2024 and it was the move by Google to accelerate the embrace of passkeys.

Progress!!

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-05-03
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Ah, the Friday news dump. Let’s see the memes!</p><p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p><h3>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h3><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><h3>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p15#a250502p15">https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p15#a250502p15</a></p><h3>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p3#a250502p3">https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p3#a250502p3</a></p><h3>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p26#a250502p26">https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p26#a250502p26</a></p><h3>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p21#a250502p21">https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p21#a250502p21</a></p><h3>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p27#a250502p27">https://www.techmeme.com/250502/p27#a250502p27</a></p>
