<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->One headline for a Thursday Throwback caught my eye. Specifically, the claim of ~5.6 Tbps of traffic during the peak of _one_ DDoS attack.

For perspective, in 2013 there was _one_ DDoS attack that "almost broke the Internet" which was claimed to be ~0.085 Tbps of traffic.

My point is, the comparisons are quite a bit different. The mitigation techniques and expansion of the Cloudflare business has likely changed. 

Also likely is those differences have turned into a different kind of data claim for marketing purposes. So, I do wonder if the claims will one day relate to the theoretical throughput of a modern multi-Tbps Ethernet switch slot or a collection of switches at fully populated slot capacity.
