### 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-21
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><h3>Quick Recap</h3><p>For Market Monday, I look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple Yahoo Finance webpage each week. It’s how I look at things at the closing bell on Monday.</p><figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6f94b79f-20a0-48e1-851c-121dba31318b.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-21" draggable="false"></a><figcaption>A few green things on 📈 Markets Monday for 2024-10-21</figcaption></figure><p>Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance.

### 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-10-22
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Two hot takes on the two stories caught my eye on Tuesday.</p><p>💰 + 🥬 If (big if?) robots can be directed by CV/AI/ML to do the weeding, will it change farm labor to favor well capitalized industrial farming? Or, would this provide the ability for more farms with greater diversity to be practical? If so, does this mean the need for weed killing chemicals in agriculture diminishes or goes away?</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241021/p11#a241021p11">https://www.techmeme.com/241021/p11#a241021p11</a></p><p>💰 + 💊 If wet lab science and AI were applied in equal measure, does this shorten the timeline to achieve impact from innovation? Does harnessing AI provide safer and faster time to market for <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">small molecule inhibitors targeting proteins associated with certain form of cancer?</span> </p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241018/p18#a241018p18">https://www.techmeme.com/241018/p18#a241018p18</a></p>

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-10-26
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p><h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><p>In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.</p><h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241024/p40#a241024p40">https://www.techmeme.com/241024/p40#a241024p40</a></p><h4>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241025/p2#a241025p2">https://www.techmeme.com/241025/p2#a241025p2</a></p><h4>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241026/p3#a241026p3">https://www.techmeme.com/241026/p3#a241026p3</a></p><h4>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241025/p13#a241025p13">https://www.techmeme.com/241025/p13#a241025p13</a></p><h4>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241025/p27#a241025p27">https://www.techmeme.com/241025/p27#a241025p27</a></p>
