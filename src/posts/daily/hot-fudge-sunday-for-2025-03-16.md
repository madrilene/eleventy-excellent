## Quick Recaps

An update to my SXSW 2025 post is coming soon. Along with the update, I'll be changing up my workflow for the balance of 2025.

https://fudge.org/archive/my-sxsw-2025-post/

Previously, I've experimented with iPhone Voice Memos transcription and Obsidian using built-in iPhone transcription. Next up, I'll also be experimenting with two new devices and their respective "AI" services. 

https://www.limitless.ai

https://www.plaud.ai

My goal is to see how transcription and use of pre-trained models for generating highlights can benefit my workflow. We shall see.

## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). I also continue to participate in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc).

As a reminder, per our reader survey, each week, I’m going to be highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. I strongly encourage my readers to view the LinkedIn profiles of these professionals, connect, and reach out to them.

I'm also pleased to add an Alumni 🎉 section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.
