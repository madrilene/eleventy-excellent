## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). I also continue to participate in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc).

As a reminder, per our reader survey, each week, I’m going to be highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. I strongly encourage my readers to view the LinkedIn profiles of these professionals, connect, and reach out to them.

I'm also pleased to add an Alumni 🎉 section this week for those that have transitioned from [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) to their next career adventure.

## 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2025-02-11
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Two hot takes for two stories that caught my eye on Tuesday.</p><p>🍪 + 💰 Chips are back in season again so it makes sense to see a grab for vertical integration and custom silicon ambitions to offset NVIDIA only procurement at scale outside the US — and especially if there are dithering tariffs to be considered.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250211/p29#a250211p29">https://www.techmeme.com/250211/p29#a250211p29</a></p><p>🍪 + 💰 That said, the appeal of manufacturing chips close to home within the US is another way to avoid dithering tariffs by investing in the US as a quasi-home team advantage.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250211/p41#a250211p41">https://www.techmeme.com/250211/p41#a250211p41</a></p>

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-02-15
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.

Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><p>In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.</p><h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p30#a250214p30">https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p30#a250214p30</a></p><h4>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p6#a250214p6">https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p6#a250214p6</a></p><h4>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p7#a250214p7">https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p7#a250214p7</a></p><h4>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p14#a250214p14">https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p14#a250214p14</a></p><h4>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p21#a250214p21">https://www.techmeme.com/250214/p21#a250214p21</a></p>
