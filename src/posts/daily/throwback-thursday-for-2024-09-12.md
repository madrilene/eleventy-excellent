Intel.</p><p>In late 1999, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/1999/CN092899.htm">Intel got into the web hosting business</a> by launching Intel Online Services (IOS). </p><p>See if this part sounds familiar:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Second-Generation Hosting</strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Intel Online Services' main focus is its second-generation hosting, in which standard, hardware and software is integrated, validated, and managed by Intel Online Services. Using this approach, Intel Online Services provides not just the building, power and network connection - called co-location hosting - but also the servers, operating system software and basic applications. By providing and managing this second-generation hardware and software platform, Intel Online Services can offer a higher degree of predictability and reliability. This can also reduce the cost for customers, since they don't have to hire IT staffs, buy computers, configure software, or carry out other costly tasks. Intel Online Services, Inc., is an Intel subsidiary that intends to be a leading supplier of hosted Internet services, business applications, and e-Commerce services worldwide.</span></p></blockquote><p>Source: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/in040400.htm">Intel News Release, 2000</a></p><p>By 2000, IOS announced it would allocate $1B to bring <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/in040400.htm">10 Internet Data Centers (IDCs)</a> online.</p><p>By early 2002, IOS had signed customers with iconic brands such as Sony, eBay, BP, Tour de France, EMI, MSN,&nbsp;American Stock Exchange, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, BBC, </span><span>and others with partners like EMC that provided technology for hosting “</span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2000/cn112700.htm">multiple terabytes of storage</a><span>” that seem rather quaint today but was bleeding edge a quarter century ago.</span></p><p>However, life moves fast and so did the .com boom.
