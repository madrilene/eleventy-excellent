<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext --><h1>Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-07-05</h1><p>Looking back at the week with an eye to the future.</p><p>For July, I am having a weekly coffee meetup and have decided to go with LinkedIn Events then drive registrations on Luma.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/coffeeatthevault7212552429198848000/comments/">https://www.linkedin.com/events/coffeeatthevault7212552429198848000/comments/</a></p><p>Getting people to register is a lot of friction and I assumed nobody showed. But, this morning The Vault is packed with lots of day pass folks and we ran out of clean coffee cups. 🤣</p><p>Next week, for coffee, Cru is right next door to The Vault and that will be the future meeting place for Friday Coffee. The lesson learned: If the event has coffee in the name… make sure you can get coffee — so Cru it shall be!</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.beaufortcru.com">https://www.beaufortcru.com</a></p><p>The week after next, I’ll be heading to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.raleighfounded.com/locations/raleigh-founded-centennial">Raleigh Founded - NCSU</a> in Raleigh July 17, 2024 for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/summer-career-fair-tickets-884125311607">Summer Career Fair</a>.</p><p>In August, I’m not planning heavy travel but it is TBD if I will be a delegate for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://techfieldday.com/event/sharekc2024/">Tech Field Day Extra at SHARE</a> in Kansas City August 5-7, 2024.</p><p>This week, I continued the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hot.fudge.org/">Hot Fudge Daily</a><span style="color: rgb(64, 64, 64)"> digest posted in </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hot.fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-06-30">🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday</a><span style="color: rgb(64, 64, 64)"> as “free” weekly content.</span></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org/archive/sprawl-walk-run/">https://fudge.org/archive/sprawl-walk-run/</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://hot.fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-06-30/">https://hot.fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday-for-2024-06-30/</a></p><p>By next month <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://fudge.org">fudge.org</a> will become a funnel to drive more traffic to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://hot.fudge.org">hot.fudge.org</a> newsletter with automated sponsorship management via Buttondown. At that point, I will reclaim <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://fudge.org">fudge.org</a> for blogging in ways that do not carry over easily to email.</p><p>In somewhat related news, my use of Mastodon has been pretty minimal but an interesting experiment. However, most of my social updates flow to LinkedIn these days. <br><br>I just signed up for Buffer again now that free accounts can federate across three destinations. So, I am also considering a similar reclamation move for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://cuthrell.com">cuthrell.com</a> to be an alias or do something with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://qthrul.com">qthrul.com</a> as a holding site for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://cuthrell.consulting">cuthrell.consulting</a> then formalize <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://cuthrell.net">cuthrell.net</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://cuthrell.org">cuthrell.org</a>.</p><ol class="footnotes"></ol>
