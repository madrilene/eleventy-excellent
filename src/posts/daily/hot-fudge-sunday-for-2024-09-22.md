### 🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-09-17
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>The numbers this week are once again big numbers.</p><p>These three stories caught my eye.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240917/p29#a240917p29">https://www.techmeme.com/240917/p29#a240917p29</a></p><p>💰 + 🤖 $100B+ is an interesting number (now that $30B+ has been raised within this AI specific fund) and it goes to show that even companies like Microsoft that <em>could</em> tap their cash reserves alone are facing funding crunch needs that require <em>multiple</em> parties. 🤔</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p30#a240916p30">https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p30#a240916p30</a></p><p>💰 + 🤑 Oh. Well. This is awkward. So, from a Microsoft perspective, AI is expensive… and so is a stock buyback program. Got it. Cool. Cool. 😳</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240913/p7#a240913p7">https://www.techmeme.com/240913/p7#a240913p7</a></p><p>💰 + 🤖 Spatial is fascinating, and it reminded me of how spatially dumb our smart phones (still?) are today — I still have fond memories of Fei-Fei Li on stage at a conference&nbsp;many years ago where the Googler entourage in the first several rows had not yet figured out their new Android OS updates for silence settings and it was HILARIOUS hearing their devices all chirping, dinging, ringing, etc. as they frantically tried to turn them off or make them go silent (unsuccessfully). 😂</p>

### ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-09-20
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>As of this update, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/">AI Field Day 5</a> for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/events/">Tech Field Day</a> videos are posted and I am wrapping up publishing my delegate notes on Keysight, Integrail, Cisco, VMware, Elastic,&nbsp;Arista, and&nbsp;Enfabrica <em>as well as</em> a Delegate Ignite Talk series and Delegate Roundtable.</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>I would like to give a HUGE shout out to the team that makes Tech Field Day possible and to Futurum Group as well the sponsoring companies for making the event possible. 🙏 🙏 🙏</p></blockquote><p>Once again, I am thankful for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://cuthrell.consulting/services/">new and ongoing client work</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://calendly.com/jaycuthrell/catch-up">catching up</a> with past co-workers. Catching up on sleep from the travel means it is back to the gym and hiking in sensible shoes then digging into my non-technology projects.</p><p>The biggest stories this week were a mixed for me. On the one hand, I get that tech journalism has to earn their impressions and drive clicks. On the other hand, clicks from spicy headlines sometimes turn into reading just a few hundred words that do not support the headline. 🤷‍♂️</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p20#a240916p20">https://www.techmeme.com/240916/p20#a240916p20</a></p><p>For context, I personally and professionally know 100s of people at AWS all over the planet.

That’s a good thing.</p><p>When I think about data centers (which is a lot), it reminds me that builders and operators of data centers work with regional power providers to secure vPPAs or PPAs as well as ensure all uses of public lands for any new transmission lines, substations, and related infrastructure builds are reviewed with the relevant utilities commission to be consistent with regulatory requirements, attestation of environmental impact including WUE/PEU as well as noise abatement commitments, zoning laws, third-party supplier agreements, and any public-private partnerships that involve permitting, construction, and neighboring community outreach/communications/etc.</p><p>That’s a lot.

### 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-09-21
 
<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p><h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4><p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p><p>In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.</p><h4>Insert Let's See Who This Really Is Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p19#a240920p19">https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p19#a240920p19</a></p><h4>Insert Ceiling Cat Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p35#a240919p35">https://www.techmeme.com/240919/p35#a240919p35</a></p><h4>Insert We're All Trying To Find The Guy Who Did This Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p3#a240920p3">https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p3#a240920p3</a></p><h4>Insert That Wasn't Me, That Was Patricia Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p21#a240920p21">https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p21#a240920p21</a></p><h4>Insert Anthony Adams Rubbing Hands Meme</h4><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p5#a240920p5">https://www.techmeme.com/240920/p5#a240920p5</a></p><p></p>
