<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Travel changes this week mean I am still updating my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/">AI Field Day 5</a> delegate notes that sit in my drafts pile to be published. Due to the travel changes, I also missed out on Monktoberfest (again!) but I am thankful for the amazing organizers that helped me find a way to give back in my absence.</p><p>Two big numbers stories that caught me eye this week:</p><ul><li><p>For perspective, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14">3.8 Tbps</a> is Terabits per second per second (i.e. trillions)… and is equivalent of fully saturating a 32 port 100G Ethernet LAN switch with traffic… and then adding even more traffic on top… but now, imagine that traffic flowing over the Internet to one place every second. My math might be off but that’s like sending two dozen compressed text copies of Wikipedia… every second… or if you double-side printed the compressed text copies of Wikipedia as wartime payload… that would be like three Iowa-class battleships firing those Wikipedias —&nbsp;every second. 🤯</p></li><li><p>I’ve written about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://hot.fudge.org/archive/?q=poolside">Poolside</a> before and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26">$500M is a staggering Series B raise</a> for the very precise focus their leadership has shared publicly. 🤯</p></li></ul><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14">https://www.techmeme.com/241004/p14#a241004p14</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26">https://www.techmeme.com/241002/p26#a241002p26</a></p><p></p>
