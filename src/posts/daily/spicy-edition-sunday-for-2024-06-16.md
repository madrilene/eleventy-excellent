<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext --><p>Welcome to 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday!</p><p>Uncover the spicy inspiration behind this week's Fudge Sunday edition, packed with deep links and fresh insights. 🔥</p><p>I just published the latest edition of Fudge Sunday. 🚀</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fudge.org/archive/hot-fudge-daily-digest/">https://fudge.org/archive/hot-fudge-daily-digest/</a></p><h2>Back to the spicy…</h2><p>As I mentioned previously, I am still working on my 11ty stack and getting the starter framework from 1.x to 3.1.1 with a goal to migrate over within the next few months. Then I started wondering if I was reliant upon a macro tool and disabled to see if I really wanted the text replacement or not. As of Day 2 for this experiment, I miss it. I might plunk down for a full version of Alfred 5.5 or explore other tools that have been recommended in my various Slack deep web communities. Ah, the never ending search for a toolchain or workflow optimizing time saving sprocket continues... 🐿️</p><p>In other news, while checking on settings for my various web properties, I realized my Google Tag had been removed from Netlify code injection. So, I have no idea what traffic has been on the flow and paths taken side of my writing. 🧐</p><p>This is a small problem to fix by simply adding back the Google Tag within the header partial for my 11ty framework. So, it isn’t a big deal to get back to where I was before the change. I don’t recall exactly <em>why</em> I made the change but it was in late 2023. Or was that just a naming convention and I had forgotten or maybe I made a mistake and got distracted? 🤔</p><p>The reason I bring this up is that statistics will matter to me each month as I decide how Fudge Sunday and Hot Fudge Daily help Cuthrell Consulting. As such, I am learning from others that have succeeded in this newsletter space. I have been bookmarking other successful newsletters landing pages and their sponsorship pages as a collection of ideas to test and consider for both Fudge Sunday and Hot Fudge Daily — and sponsorships tend to favor those newsletters with strong analytics stories to tell. 🚀</p><p>For now, I will be keeping up the Digest format for Fudge Sunday that captures Hot Fudge Daily for the week prior. ⌨️</p><ol class="footnotes"></ol>
