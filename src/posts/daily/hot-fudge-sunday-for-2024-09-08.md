<h3>📈 Markets Monday for 2024-09-02</h3>
<p>Labor Day is an important national holiday and important part of the relatively short history of the United States. 🇺🇸</p>

<h4>Reading Recommendation</h4>
<p>The technology market can be hard to keep up with and if you aren’t reading <a href="https://www.thestack.technology/">The Stack</a>, you should be. As for why, check out this article from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardtargett/">Ed Targett</a>.</p>

<h4>Markets Monday Memories</h4>
<p>Speaking of IPv4 address costs…</p>
<p>My career has seen a lot of post-merger integration work and one instance involved one (1) Class B network. During PMI, I discovered that there should have been two (2!) Class B networks conveyed with the acquisition and eventually the acquiring company ended up owning the second Class B too. 💰</p>
<p>For perspective, in today&#39;s post February 1, 2024 AWS IPv4 address per hour dollars, two (2) Class B would be worth up to <em><strong>~$6M per year</strong></em>. That’s a lot of operating capital to set fire to which is perhaps yet another reason to try harder to sunset IPv4 and move to IPv6. 💸</p>

<h4>Quick Recap</h4>
<p>As a Market Monday reminder and recap, what I try to do each week is look at the same key indicator that I take from a simple yahoo finance webpage. It’s not much but it’s how I look at things and this is what I saw today after the bell closed.</p>
<p>Previously, I decided on a view from Yahoo Finance. For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.</p>
<p>If you are using <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap">Yahoo Applied Filters for Stocks</a> screener you can bookmark your own heat map view.</p>
<ul>
<li>% Change in Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than 4</strong></li>
<li>Region: <strong>United States</strong></li>
<li>Market Cap (Intraday): <strong>Mid Cap and Large Cap and Mega Cap</strong></li>
<li>Price (Intraday):<strong>greater than or equal 5</strong></li>
<li>Volume:<strong>greater than 15000</strong></li>
<li>Sector: <strong>Technology</strong></li>

<h3>🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday for 2024-09-03</h3>
<p>First… an observation and a question.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-08-21-gartner-2024-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-highlights-developer-productivity-total-experience-ai-and-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bfca3f64-fba4-4614-81c2-1a0844b4b22c.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2024" draggable="false" contenteditable="false"></a><figcaption>Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2024</figcaption></figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>By the time our&nbsp;industry achieves ubiquitous AI infrastructure that is as agile, elastic, cost-effective, and TRiSM mature when compared to current non-AI infrastructure, will practitioners have moved on to another non-AI technology marvel (shiny object! squirrel!) or will AI be the defining specialization of the next several decades?</p></blockquote><p>If you are reading this question in your internal voice of wonder, I’d love to get your thoughts in a reply.</p>
<p>And now, back to our regular Hot Takes Tuesday…</p>
<h4>Funds, Funding, and M&amp;A</h4>
<p>Let’s take a look at where the money is flowing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240828/p24#a240828p24">https://www.techmeme.com/240828/p24#a240828p24</a></p>
<p>💰 + 🤖 BIG numbers are only big until they are not and I’m curious to see if Thrive’s thesis for OpenAI turns into a unicorn, decacorn, etc. cut down valuation trend a year from now on everything else that was similar to Tiger’s this time last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240829/p24#a240829p24">https://www.techmeme.com/240829/p24#a240829p24</a></p>
<p>💰 + 🤖 Speaking of BIG numbers, the amount of implied spending by Magic on Google Cloud alone is remarkable and seems to mimic what Poolside seems to imply in their published interviews around A.I. coding tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240829/p21#a240829p21">https://www.techmeme.com/240829/p21#a240829p21</a></p>
<p>💰 + 🤖 Speaking of A.I. coding tools, Codeium is a unicorn 🦄 now too and the market could still absorb a few dozen more like it if (when?) the specialization around A.I. demands more coding tools for more challenges ahead.</p>

<h3>🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2024-09-05</h3>
<p>My early career in the late 1990s was in telecommunications. I worked for a company called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKjAMxzdrHw">Nortel Networks</a> before I pivoted to become a <a href="https://fudge.org/archive/and-for-my-next-trick/">global road warrior / consultant</a> during the .com boom.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKjAMxzdrHw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKjAMxzdrHw</a></p>
<p>Back then a “cloud” on a network diagram was often meant to depict the <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/09/26/Sprint-to-offer-new-data-transmission-network/5008654321600/">Sprint frame relay network</a>. Times have changed a bit since then and “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-cloud-computing/">cloud computing</a>” became “the cloud” we know today.</p>
<p>Over the years, traditional telecom wireline business (copper telephone lines) fell into a less desirable category as mobile, broadband, high speed fiber optics networks, and cloud computing took hold of investor attention.</p>
<p>If you remember AT&amp;T at SXSW 2009, the mobile carrier was trying but was unable to keep up with all the Internet connected mobile devices. The following year the <a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/a-year-later-att-shines-at-sxsw/">lessons learned from many thousands of mobile phones trying to reach the Internet in one small city</a> went into motion for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQAEd3fjhY">SXSW 2010 using many COWs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQAEd3fjhY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQAEd3fjhY</a></p>
<p>Of course, AT&amp;T wasn’t the only mobile carrier. There was also Verizon.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to look at my writing back in 2010, you might have associated <a href="https://1000logos.net/verizon-logo/">Verizon</a> with <a href="https://readwrite.com/day-1-verizon-developer-commun/">cutting edge technology</a>. You might have even considered Verizon to be a <a href="https://readwrite.com/day-2-verizon-developer-commun/">developer oriented</a> company.</p>
<p>In fact, Verizon got into the cloud business in 2011. Verizon Cloud was born!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/press-releases/verizon-completes-terremark-acquisition">https://www.verizon.com/about/news/press-releases/verizon-completes-terremark-acquisition</a></p>
<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>So too did AT&amp;T have cloud ambitions, but that’s for another Throwback Thursday. We’ll get there.</p></blockquote><p>However, cloud computing had been pioneered at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft for over a decade and by 2017, Verizon got out of the cloud computing business it had acquired in 2011.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/170503/p12#a170503p12">https://www.techmeme.com/170503/p12#a170503p12</a></p>
<p>Oh, and remember Sprint and that version of the original “cloud”?</p>
<p>Well, $26B later in 2020 dollars…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/t-mobile-sprint-one-company">https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/t-mobile-sprint-one-company</a></p>
<p>Also, the cloud within the US market is now firmly associated with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, IBM, and a growing number of niche providers from REITs to XaaS players.</p>
<p>Still, within the US market, the largest names associated with telecom became AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.</p>
<p>However, there were many other telecom brands that were operating as well but far below the size of AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34)">Fast forward to the present… What old is what’s new again.</span></p>

<h3>✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2024-09-06</h3>
<p>As a reminder, I’ve committed to four events for the remainder of this year.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://techfieldday.com/event/aifd5/">AI Field Day 5</a> in Silicon Valley September 9-13, 2024 for <a href="https://techfieldday.com/events/">Tech Field Day</a></li>
<li><a href="https://monktoberfest.com/">Monktoberfest</a> in Portland October 1-4, 2024</li>
<li><a href="https://techfieldday.com/event/cfd21/">Cloud Field Day 21</a> in Silicon Valley October 23-25, 2024 for <a href="https://techfieldday.com/events/">Tech Field Day</a></li>
<li><a href="https://2024.allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a> in Raleigh October 27-29, 2024 for <a href="https://allthingsopen.org/events/community-leadership-summit-cls-2">CLS</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, the week in review is about being thankful for <a href="https://cuthrell.consulting/services/">new and ongoing client work</a>, catching up with folks I haven’t spoken to for years, and meeting new folks. Gym and hiking continues as I plan to reach personal goals in a list of non-technology projects.</p>
<p>Switching gears back to technology, the bigger tech stories this week seemed to be BGP, Internet Archive, Salesforce + Own(Backup), and YouTube/Google. My thinking is this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240903/p33#a240903p33">https://www.techmeme.com/240903/p33#a240903p33</a></p>
<p>The thing about BGP and this coverage is that years have passed since the last time this was considered a big deal. By that, I mean the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/09/a-project-aims-to-help-isps-to-mind-their-routing-security-manners/">Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) published metrics</a> are reaching the 5 years old mark and even got a footnote in the PDF from the White House.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240904/p38#a240904p38">https://www.techmeme.com/240904/p38#a240904p38</a></p>
<p>Some pundits have called this the two tier system of justice where it is IA doing something wonderful for humanity vs. well funded “techbro” AI training on anything it wants and asking for forgiveness later. My takeaway is that if IA gets this kind of treatment, the various purveyors of GenAI/LLM training using published materials better save some of that funding, get lawyered up — and quickly, and get ready for the pain train of precedent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240905/p37#a240905p37">https://www.techmeme.com/240905/p37#a240905p37</a></p>
<p>Not a lot of folks may realize this, but <a href="https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2023/introducing-salesforce-backup-your-datas-safety-net">Salesforce never had their own native way of doing back up and recovery until very recently</a>. That&#39;s right! Previously, it was only third-party companies and managed service providers that dealt with how to backup, protect, and recover Salesforce data. Many of these providers have expanded or started in other SaaS data management and data protection services. My takeaway is that Salesforce now has, arguably, one of the best of these third-party manage service providers that was and is vastly more successful with Salesforce customers than the native <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/platform/data-backup-recovery/">Salesforce Backup and recovery service</a> it launched a year ago. As for Own customers using Own for other SaaS backup and recovery related services… (i.e. possible Salesforce wallet share/shift “competitors” like ServiceNow and Microsoft…) well, that might be another story or possibly a carve out to be determined.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240906/p13#a240906p13">https://www.techmeme.com/240906/p13#a240906p13</a></p>
<p>YouTube has truly amazing content on the one hand and on the other it often seems become a place where you can look up a tame benign topic.. and the feed algorithm will look at the most banal heuristic like an IP address to flood you with awful suggestion published by some not so nice people. So, this is clearly a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocking</a> thing that nobody paying attention was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocked</a> to see confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240906/p22#a240906p22">https://www.techmeme.com/240906/p22#a240906p22</a></p>
<p>Speaking of being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocked</a>, it is probably not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shocking</a> that Google monopoly ruling remedies can has been kicked down the road for another year from now.</p>

<h3>🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2024-09-07</h3>
<p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week.</p>
<h4>Peak 🏔️ vs. Peek 👀</h4>
<p>Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.</p>
<p>In that spirit, here are a few stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.</p>
