## #OpenToWork Weekly

I believe in [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA). I also continue to participate in a [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc). 

Per our reader survey, each week, I’m going to be highlighting those in my network that are [#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23OpenToWork&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&postedBy=%5B%22first%22%5D&sid=TbC&sortBy=%22date_posted%22) by linking to their LinkedIn and quoting their LinkedIn About section. I strongly encourage my readers to view the LinkedIn profiles of these professionals, connect, and reach out to them.

## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-01-02
 
<p>Long ago in the late 1990s, I was deeply involved in telecommunications. Specifically, this was my early career working with Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p><p>At that time, facilities based broadband providers were just beginning to take hold in the United States. The shift from dialup to ISDN to DSL, Cable, and Fixed Wireless broadband was amazing.</p><p>Of course, open competition in the market is a big part of what made business in the United States successful. By 2005, the term “Net Neutrality” came into the lexicon.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2005/10/28/network-neutrality-wouldnt-matter-if-there-was-real-competition/">https://www.techdirt.com/2005/10/28/network-neutrality-wouldnt-matter-if-there-was-real-competition/</a></p><p>Of course, the United States is a big place and a really young experiment as nation go. So, getting broadband everywhere was a very big deal and it was often a story of a digital divide — and it still is even in 2025.</p><p>As my career in telecom progressed, I came to appreciate how essential broadband would be and how stark the differences are for those without access to broadband. And now, the early attempts at eliminating aspects of the digital divide will need to modernize as laws of the land in the United States.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/250102/p17#a250102p17">https://www.techmeme.com/250102/p17#a250102p17</a></p><p></p>

## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-01-04
 
<p>By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line.
