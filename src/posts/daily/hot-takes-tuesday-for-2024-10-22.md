<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: fancy --><p>Two hot takes on the two stories caught my eye on Tuesday.</p><p>💰 + 🥬 If (big if?) robots can be directed by CV/AI/ML to do the weeding, will it change farm labor to favor well capitalized industrial farming? Or, would this provide the ability for more farms with greater diversity to be practical? If so, does this mean the need for weed killing chemicals in agriculture diminishes or goes away?</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241021/p11#a241021p11">https://www.techmeme.com/241021/p11#a241021p11</a></p><p>💰 + 💊 If wet lab science and AI were applied in equal measure, does this shorten the timeline to achieve impact from innovation? Does harnessing AI provide safer and faster time to market for <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">small molecule inhibitors targeting proteins associated with certain form of cancer?</span> </p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.techmeme.com/241018/p18#a241018p18">https://www.techmeme.com/241018/p18#a241018p18</a></p>
