<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext --><h1>📈 Markets Monday for 2024-07-15</h1><p>Analyzing the past and future of the tech market in Markets Monday.</p><h2>Last week</h2><p>Looking at the week behind for the tech market.</p><p>I typically ask Siri how NASDAQ is doing and wait to hear it if is a big change or not. Siri logic on the definition of what to say if the there is +/- &lt; 1% seems to be varied by day of attempts. More experimentation or going deeper into how Siri makes word choices will be interesting as the new Apple WWDC stories of Siri evolve over the year.</p><p>Previously, I mentioned adding a 5 day view contrasted with a 5 year view.</p><figure><a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?&amp;window=5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/8ab8b8e8-e530-4c8c-93b7-77c431cfaa7d.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="5 day view" draggable="false" contenteditable="false"></a><figcaption>5 day view</figcaption></figure><p>Last week I corrected my prior error and gathered the intended 5D view.

For example, this was a view of intraday in Technology which usually gets around a dozen or so interesting companies.</p><p>The winners list last narrowed from five to… two.</p><p>Last week the expansion where the two (before the bell) went to fifteen. This week I waited for the bell.</p><figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/cad65354-15f0-4aa8-87d9-a3fdd325ccdd.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Heat Map view this week" draggable="false" contenteditable="false"></a><figcaption>Heat Map view last week</figcaption></figure><p></p><figure><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/568c8b06-3f3e-497e-bae7-6dd1defc231c/heatmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6fa1324f-4b8b-4ef9-a20a-b638803287d2.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="Heat map view this week" draggable="false" contenteditable="false"></a><figcaption>Heat map view this week</figcaption></figure><p>This week went from 15 down to 13.
