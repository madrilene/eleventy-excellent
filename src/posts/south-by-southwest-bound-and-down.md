# Getting Informed

I submitted a [proposal for a talk at SxSW 2024](https://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/133870). 

- Title: [\_Have Your AI Call My AI in 2024\_](https://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/133870)
- Audience: Founders, Hackers, Enthusiasts, Tinkerers, and Dreamers
- Format: Presentation
- Level: Intermediate
- Track: Artificial Intelligence

> What if every human had a fundamental right to have their own AI... for the express purpose of interfacing with other AI? A decade ago, my blog post ["ESTEEM is STEM plus Ethics plus Empathy"](https://fudge.org/archive/esteem-is-stem-plus-ethics-plus-empathy/) considered disruptive technologies such as AI and the need for expanding STEM to include Ethics and Empathy. Then in 2016, the blog post ["Have your AI call my AI"](https://fudge.org/archive/have-your-ai-call-my-ai/) was provoked by hyperbolic claims of AI taking over everything. Now, as we enter 2024, societal considerations for AI have shifted from hyperbole to [practical impacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwxDNbD0fes) and the need for increased caution as well as public private governance.

[Voting](https://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/133870) will begin on Tuesday 08 August 2023 and end on Monday 21 August 2023 — super exciting!



Before I go further down the SxSW 2024 rabbit hole, it's time for reading 📖, watching 📺, and listening 🎧 suggestions:

- First, [📖 WebAssembly (Wasm): An Updated Roadmap for Developers](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/webassembly-the-updated-roadmap-for-developers) in which [Bailey Hayes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baileyhayes/) provides an update on the state of the Wasm ecosystem and shares the [📺 July 2023 Bytecode Alliance Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl\_O95zOJbs) by walking through the now, new, next from Core Wasm to Wasm Component Model to Wasm System Interface (WASI).

- Second , a double shot from [The Cloudcast](https://www.thecloudcast.net/) on [🎧 What's Happening with SuperCloud?](https://www.thecloudcast.net/2023/08/whats-happening-with-supercloud.html) where [Aaron Delp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarondelp/) and [Brian Gracely](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briangracely/) interview [Dave Vellante](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvellante/) of [Breaking Analysis podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7u9nQywKYm1s8hoqIjCcoM) as well as [🎧 The PizzaHut and TacoBell of Platforms](https://www.thecloudcast.net/2023/08/the-pizzahut-and-tacobell-of-platforms.html) where Brian applies a bit of a wink wink nod nod [Yum Brands](https://www.yum.com/wps/portal/yumbrands/Yumbrands/company/) mashup analogies to the notion of platform engineering and the buckets pundits and vendors tend to lump things into.

- Third, [📺 🤔 what exactly is...watsonx?](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7093359957890240512/) in which [Nicholas Renotte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasrenotte/) applies outstanding video content skills, top practitioner chops, and undergoes multiple wardrobe changes to deliver a superbly succinct summary on all things [IBM watsonx](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx)! 🍿🤯🤓☁️🚀.

## We're gonna do what they say can't be done 🎶

Back to SxSW for a moment... and looking back 15 years to SxSW 2008.

I wrote [The Taco Thesis](https://fudge.org/archive/the-taco-thesis/) in 2008. It was my first time attending SxSW.

- Was it my best writing? No.
- Are there cringe elements? Yes.
- Have I grown up a wee bit since 2008? Gosh, I like to think so.

In March 2008, besides SxSW, many things were not what they are today — myself included. So, it's nice to look back and reflect a bit — even if there is repeating of some history that rhymes.

The market cap of Apple was \_only\_ ~$76B and at the time of SxSW 2008, Apple announced [+100K developers had downloaded the beta iPhone Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://www.techmeme.com/080312/h1700).
 
The glitter backgrounds of MySpace were found on many of its ~100M users at the time of SxSW 2008. If those user profiles had an auto-play profile song, it was probably ["Low" by Flo Rida featuring T-Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckKFxMw6z0c) — which like cost MySpace a small fortune and was [eventually disabled](https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/18/myspace-disables-auto-play-of-profile-songs-to-get-streaming-costs-under-control/).

The average price for a gallon of gasoline at the time of SxSW 2008 was around $3 and would later peak at around $4 for the year. So, the talk of post-financial crisis or a new improved crisis was fodder for then traditional news media.

## We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there 🎶

Now, it's time to talk about SxSW 2024. As you might expect, I have plans.

I just \_successfully\_ purchased a badge for SxSW 2024 and, for now, have marveled at the going rate for the hotel room where I usually stayed during prior SxSW years 👀💸🤔.

Granted, SxSW is a polarizing prohibitively pricey event for most, and as someone that lived in Austin, Texas for years — yes, I understand that vibe. Still, my goal is to visit, learn, share knowledge, and contribute to the local economy whenever possible / practical.

Of course, like any conference, SxSW is a socially oriented event but was also where early social media latched on in a big way. However, as with most web properties, change is hard — and the SxSW Social (a sort of SxSW only social network) still prompts you for [Google+](https://fudge.org/archive/google-nonplussed/)... perhaps in a bid to collect all those Google Workspace folks [moving from what was Google+ for Business to what became Currents to what is now Spaces](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/new-community-features-for-google-chat-and-an-update-currents%20.html)? 🤣


As of this issue of Fudge Sunday, SxSW Social does not recognize Mastodon (how would it?) or Bluesky or Fediverse alternatives.

Also, I am not a gamer per se — but in 2008, I opined there should be a "SxSW Games". Clearly, I was not alone in that opinion so it eventually came true and now it is three (3!) days long.



You might have noticed the five (5!) day block devoted to \_"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"\_. Again, I'm pumped for [Panel Picker](https://panelpicker.sxsw.com) voting to begin this week!

Leading up to March 2024, I plan to justify my investment by capturing all my findings in Fudge Sunday installments. Eventually, my findings will culminate in a bigger summary issue on Sunday 17 March 2024 (or the week after if I need to recover from the dreaded ["SxSW-crud"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22SxSW-crud%22&t=osx&ia=web)).

So, what will be the next big thing at SxSW 2024 and beyond?

Until then… Place your bets!
