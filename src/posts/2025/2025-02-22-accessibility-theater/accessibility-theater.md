## Introduction
Good evening, and welcome to Masterpiece Digital Theater. Tonight we present a compelling drama that explores the world of digital accessibility - or rather, its charlatan counterfeits.

"Accessibility Theater: The Cautionary Tale of Overlays" takes us into the modern boardrooms and living rooms where the drama of digital inclusion, or exclusion, plays out daily. Our story examines how not-so-well intentioned solutions can become mere performance, a facade of accessibility that ultimately fails those it claims to serve.

A play in three acts...

## Characters

*   WEBSITE OWNER: A well-meaning but uninformed business owner
*   OVERLAY VENDOR: A smooth-talking sales rep
*   ANGELA: A blind screen reader user
*   MARCUS: A web developer with accessibility expertise
*   CHORUS OF USERS: Various people with disabilities
*   THE GHOST OF ACCESSIBILITY PAST: A spectral figure representing early web accessibility efforts
*   WIDGET: A personified accessibility overlay widget

## Act I: The Promise

*Scene: A modern office. WEBSITE OWNER sits at their desk, looking worried over their desk*

WEBSITE OWNER: *(reviewing papers)* These accessibility requirements... the lawsuits... the costs... What am I supposed to do?

*( OVERLAY VENDOR appears in a cloud of smoke wearing a flashy suit with a glowing "Install Now" button as a tie pin)*

OVERLAY VENDOR: Did someone say accessibility? Fear not! With just one line of code, I can make all your problems disappear!

WEBSITE OWNER: One line of code? That sounds too good to be true!

OVERLAY VENDOR: *(grandly)* Watch this! *(waves a wand)* This little beauty, powered by cutting-edge AI, fixes everything. Fonts, contrast, screen reader compatibility – you name it!

*\[A glowing widget appears on the stage]*

WIDGET: *(mechanical voice)* I can change fonts! Adjust contrast! Read text aloud! I am the future of accessibility!

WEBSITE OWNER: Does this really work?

OVERLAY VENDOR: Trust me. Automation is the future! Why waste time and money when you can have instant results?

## Act II: The Reality

*Scene: A small office. ANGELA sits at her computer, trying to use the website.*

ANGELA: *(frustrated)* Ugh, another one of these things? “This site is now accessible!” Yeah, right. I can’t even find the damn menu. My screen reader’s going haywire.

CHORUS OF USERS: *(entering from all sides, voices overlapping)* “I already have my own tools!”**,** “This widget’s blocking everything!”, “It’s making things worse!”, “And it's tracking my data?”

*\[WIDGET starts glitching]*

WIDGET: *(stuttering)* Detecting... detecting... user preferences... Would you like to... Would you like to... Would you like to...

*(Enter THE GHOST OF ACCESSIBILITY PAST)*

GHOST: Remember when we said accessibility should be built in, not bolted on? When we wrote the WCAG guidelines way back in 1999? When we emphasized user testing? Remember...?

## Act III: The Awakening

*Scene: Back in WEBSITE OWNER's office. WEBSITE OWNER is meeting with MARCUS.*

MARCUS: The overlay can't fix most issues. It can't reliably repair:

*   Image descriptions

*   Form labels

*   Keyboard navigation

*   Complex interactive components

*   PDFs, documents, or media files

WEBSITE OWNER: But the vendor promised compliance!

*\[CHORUS OF USERS returns, each holding up their phones and laptops]*

CHORUS OF USERS: "We've started blocking these overlays!" "They collect our disability status without consent!" "They slow down pages!" "They break the tools we use!"

WEBSITE OWNER: *(to OVERLAY VENDOR)* You promised a solution, but it's all theater – a mere illusion of accessibility!

OVERLAY VENDOR: *(backing away)* But our AI... our automation... our one line of code...

MARCUS: Real accessibility takes work. Human work. Good design, proper coding, and actual user testing. There are no shortcuts.

## Epilogue

*\[All characters face the audience]*

ANGELA: True accessibility inclusion doesn’t come from an overlay.

MARCUS: It's a fundamental right.

WEBSITE OWNER: *(removing the overlay code)* We have to do this the right way.

CHORUS OF USERS: *(together)* No more theater. No more overlays. Just thoughtful, accessible design.
