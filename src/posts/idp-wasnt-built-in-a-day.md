This week we look at similarities in platform engineering, data operations (DataOps), and revenue operations (RevOps) teams.

# Getting Informed

As mentioned previously in Fudge Sunday, an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) can be thought of a uniquely custom stack or toolchain. The group of engineers that support that stack or toolchain are the platform team.

From my perspective, if you compare the goals and stacks of a platform team to the goals and stacks of a go-to-market (GTM) data operations (DataOps) or revenue operations (RevOps) team, the argument can be made that there are a particular set of learnings to be had from interlock. I also believe there are similarities in the advantages to managed alternatives to replace more manually intensive design choices.

## In this day and age, it's so easy to stress 🎶

Last week, [Evan Dunn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanpdunn/) at [Syncari](https://syncari.com/) asked me a simple question (paraphrased). Evan's question led to an elongated issue of the newsletter.

> \_Hi Jay. What are your observations on GTM data quality impact for revenue teams -- especially with unicorns?\_ -- Evan

You could say this question really plucked a string or struck a chord (nerve?) — and so I had to respond — and I did so \_within seconds\_.

> \_Evan -- oh wow! This might be getting on a bit of a soapbox. The fragility of data stream is what I've noticed. For want of a nail... For example, it's not uncommon for a unicorn to experience turnover in the key team members that created heroic pipelines when a systematic pipeline would be documented sufficiently enough to be survivable.\_ 

> \_Jobs are so plentiful that you can't fault the individual contributor for [grabbing at the next brass ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyNvJ8nBaH4). However, you can fault GTM leadership for not insisting on pipelines that are precariously held together by sheer manual efforts by their under-appreciated RevOps team members.\_

> \_Result: You chase waterfalls in revenue, mirages of margin, and get distacted... squandering time through losses from opportunity cost that compounds when you are literally sticking a wet finger in the air to gauge GTM signal.\_

Also, I've been reading the newsletter of another [Customer Data Automation Community](https://syncari.com/customer-data-automation-community/) team member, [Greg Meyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregmeyer/). You should subscribe right now if my reply struck a chord with you too.

Naturally, I believe my opinionated reply was much faster because I have been reading Greg's newsletter.

When I read Greg's newsletter, I cannot help but see patterns in DataOps and RevOps that are closely aligned to the same goals in platform engineering pursuits. Indeed, there are \_pipelines\_ that a DataOps and RevOps team must maintain for the GTM team just as their are CI/CD \_pipelines\_ that a platform engineering team must maintain and streamline for maximum software engineering team development comfort and increasing productivity.

Raising a data pipeline or an IDP might require a village. But, does it have to be that way every time or all the time?

## I'm having a daydream we are getting somewhere 🎶

Of course, adopting a \_managed to-be\_ toolchain that replaces the \_manual as-is\_ toolchain will have implications on the team composition and requires a focus on ruthless removal of annoyances associated with undifferentiated engineering[^1]. Then again, the adoption of a toolchain might start with one or more parts of a complex and precarious \_single-point-of-vacation-failure-engineer\_ time intensive pipeline.

Speaking of \_pipelines\_ that are survivable designs, I do believe that [my attempt at a Wardley map last week](https://fudge.org/archive/map-of-the-platformatique/) points to a future where Cloud Service Providers (CSP) will have opinionated stacks that can replace portions of the custom layers within toolchains and, perhaps, those toolchains within an IDP.[^2]

So, what will be the next big thing in platform engineering, data operations, and revenue operations? 

Until then… Place your bets!
