I'm truly enjoying [11ty](/topics/11ty/). I'm also looking to recapture some of the layout options I still miss from Revue (RIP) for unfurled cards the created flexible previews of embedded URLs within my newsletter.

## Getting Informed

This is a lightweight post to close out bookmarks I have been cleaning up from last month. I'll be testing with a new card format via [iFramely](https://iframely.com/try) from its markers at [Itteco Software Corp.](https://github.com/itteco).

First, I created a free account on [iFramely](https://iframely.com/try).

Second, I [customized the outputs offered](https://iframely.com/settings/cards).

Third, I gathered all the bookmarks I had been considering for sharing in the newsletter and did manual testing for a variety of embedded results. *(Yes, my reading is a bit nerdy.)*

#### Abstract graphic: works well for squared timelines

These are examples of a website where the creator has made a design choice that can accommodate the smaller card timeline format. The graphic choice is ready to be presented in a square format.

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 140px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://semiengineering.com/the-future-of-memory-4/" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsemiengineering.com%2Fthe-future-of-memory-4%2F&key=28a0c9e082758c58f784faf791c82572"></a></div></div><script async src="//cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 140px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://media.ccc.de/b/congress/2023" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.ccc.de%2Fb%2Fcongress%2F2023&key=28a0c9e082758c58f784faf791c82572"></a></div></div><script async src="//cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 140px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://desmondrivet.com/2022/04/04/eleventy-previews" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesmondrivet.com%2F2022%2F04%2F04%2Feleventy-previews&key=28a0c9e082758c58f784faf791c82572"></a></div></div><script async src="//cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### Crunched layout 1: works well even for squared timelines

While not pixel-perfect, there are examples where even a cropped square of a graphic still works well.

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 140px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://stefanbohacek.com/blog/exploring-your-fediverse-connections/" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstefanbohacek.com%2Fblog%2Fexploring-your-fediverse-connections%2F&key=28a0c9e082758c58f784faf791c82572"></a></div></div><script async src="//cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### Crunched layout 2: does not work well for squared timelines

Of course, there is the loss of context from cropping out text (to say nothing of alt text) for the smaller card timeline format.

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 140px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://smallstep.com/blog/home-network-eap-tls-wifi/" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsmallstep.com%2Fblog%2Fhome-network-eap-tls-wifi%2F&key=28a0c9e082758c58f784faf791c82572"></a></div></div><script async src="//cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### No graphic: fallback is reasonable

Then again, graphics are not compulsory and a fallback to simple text is reasonable.
  
<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 140px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://triagechallenge.darpa.mil" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftriagechallenge.darpa.mil&key=28a0c9e082758c58f784faf791c82572"></a></div></div><script async src="//cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Next, I'll be working on incorporating the [API](https://iframely.com/docs) as my free time permits. 

Until then...
