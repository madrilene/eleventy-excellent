4… 3… 2… 1

Suggested soundtrack for this section…

What an amazing time to be alive. We’re going to have mobile devices (and more) that contain multiple radios talking to multiple services.

Oh right… that’s what exists today. Ignoring the humble iPhone, there are even some smart phones that let you listen to FM radio. Yes. [Some](http://nextradioapp.com/supported-devices/?utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

Think about what happens when convergence takes the next step towards ubiquitous connectivity just about anywhere on our planet. It’s amazing to consider the possibilities.

It’s also amazing to think about what happens when it is nearly impossible find everyday items that won’t have a lot more communications capabilities built into them from the factory.

Okay… Okay… Now, back to the positive optimistic view…

Very low Earth orbit mini satellites, low motion and high motion drones, terrestrial millimeter wave radios, and a shifting tide in wireless spectrum auction winners will transform how we think of mobility. Also, our future won’t necessarily mean we will be buried in simply *smarter* handsets as generations prior were buried in smart phones, iPods, TVs, newspapers, books, or other manner of [isolation](https://xkcd.com/1601/?utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

One such development that is finally getting coverage in other media outlets is Galileo aka European Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). That’s a big deal for objects big and small that may benefit from greater precision in location.

At the same time, multiple low energy ecosystems like iBeacon, Eddystone, et al will attempt to find a way on the ever shrinking boards that make objects more addressable in the physical world. Now, if only there were a ubiquitous network to allow for communication.

Now just add in some changing social mores regarding commercially available extensions and augmentation to our humanity and technological implants. Fun times ahead…

On a slightly more humorous note, in the very near future this technology just might be what enables some people you *probably* know to finally find their gluteus maximus in the dark without the aid of both hands and a flashlight. 😂
