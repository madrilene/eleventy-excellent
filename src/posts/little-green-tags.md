This week we take a look at the past, present, and future of FinOps strategies for A.I. workloads.

This week's musical inspiration in title and lyrics:

# Getting Informed

Perhaps you've been shocked by a public cloud bill. Perhaps you've heard from peers that were shocked by a public cloud bill.

Perhaps you are being asked to do more with A.I. in a public cloud. Perhaps you are wondering if your [cloud operating model](https://fudge.org/archive/cost-cause/) or your [cloud adoption framework](https://fudge.org/archive/the-promised-landing-zones/) tagging and metadata strategies of the past will apply today or [in the future](https://fudge.org/archive/its-not-easy-being-greendevsecfinops/).

Now it's time for reading 📖, listening 🎧, watching 📺 suggestions:

- First, [📖 Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/) in which [Angel Alves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvesangel/), [Keith Knowles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithdavidknowles/), [Sounthar Manickavasagam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msounthar/), [Victoria Levy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriarlevy/), [Yogendra Joshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogendrajoshi/), [Usha Ganesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uganesh/), [Mala Vengatesan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malavengat/), [Ira Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ira-cohen-1615491/), and [Sivaprakash Durairaj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sivaprakash-durairaj-finops/) make the case for a more financially informed approach to cloud consumption with an eye towards outliers.

- Second, [🎧 Financial Challenges of M.L./A.I. Ops](https://player.captivate.fm/episode/f6bebc9c-ab25-433e-99bc-a27f83b03637) in which [Joe Daly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-daly-52789220/) abandons ChatGPT intros before he interviews [Thiago Gil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-bittencourt-gil/) on the junction of costs and implications across financial as well as societal concerns for compute selections with respect to the newest generation of workloads.

- Third, [📺 FinOps Governance & Policy for Onboarding of Workloads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL7H6oyzf7M) in which [Beth Marki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-marki/) and [Andrew Feig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/afeig/) share the wisdom of balancing simplicity in communication with the complexity of what the business expects in cloud fiscal responsibility.

## Lookin' back on the track for a little greenback 🎶

Granted, you might have heard of FinOps or maybe have your FinOps certification. You might even recall all dozen references to FinOps in Fudge Sunday over the past couple years.

Well, this week's issue will make a baker's dozen[^matt] references to FinOps. Specifically, A.I. will require a mix of both conventional wisdom and unconventional wisdom[^matt] when approached from a FinOps perspective.

What does the platform team need to consider for [landing zones](https://fudge.org/archive/the-promised-landing-zones/) meant for A.I. workloads?

## Lookin' back on the track, gonna do it my way 🎶

Is there a FinOps for A.I. required? Will there be newer players besides AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI that come into FinOps calculations and consideration?

Perhaps there was an earlier answer back in late 2021.

Perhaps that answer was confirmed again last week.

In fact, there was a case made last month for avoiding hyperscale public cloud service providers entirely — and embracing the [10th Other "R" of cloud... i.e. Repatriation](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-sunday-reflecting-and-projecting/).

https://www.techmeme.com/220803/p20#a220803p20

So, what will be the next big thing in FinOps strategies for A.I. workloads?

Until then… Place your bets!
