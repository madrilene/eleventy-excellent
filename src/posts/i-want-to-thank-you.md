Getting Informed
================

Writing this newsletter has involved several reboots. Some of my readers remember the fits and starts. Others joined in reading later and wondered how I managed to crank out a new post each week.

Please subscribe to Fudge Sunday!

Substack has been great so far. In fact, this week represents month five (5!) on Substack[1](#footnote-1) after over a year on Revue before recent Twitter drama.[2](#footnote-2)

You've been so kind and generous 🎶
----------------------------------

The attention economy is real. Another email in the inbox might be clogging arterial flow of your precious time to be enlightened.

If time is money then money is time. So, I try to bring education, utility, a sprinkle of humor, and much humility to this newsletter.

Speaking of which… there’s nothing more humbling than an unsubscribe.

[![](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)Was is something I linked?Still, each subscribe is an endorphin hit and likely dopamine release. As such, I appreciate every reader, every click, every share, and the time investments made to read my rambles.

Much has been written elsewhere about network effects on Substack. For me, the vanity stats are much smaller but align to a familiar set of statistics for the graph when things went “up” with a new subscriber addition.

* **60% of my new subscribers** ***came from Substack platform features*** **🤯**
* 20% of my new subscribers were existing Substack accounts
* 20% of my new scribers are brand new accounts on Substack

And as Michael Scott once said that Wayne Gretzky once said that Leonardo Da Vinci once famously said… 

**“A newsletter is never finished, only abandoned"**   
- Leonardo da Vinci  
 - - Wayne Gretzky  
 - - - Michael Scott

Thank you readers 🙏 for all the feedback and support to get this far. I’ll keep going as long as there are folks reading and topics that I can take a look at each week.

I never could have come this far without you 🎶
----------------------------------------------

Now I’d like to send along a thank you to the newsletters that inspire me. Your influence and impact on my own newsletter is appreciated more than you know.
