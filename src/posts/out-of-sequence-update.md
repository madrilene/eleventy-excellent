I used Obsidian to craft the content of this newsletter. Powering the jump from an Obsidian note to a Buttondown draft email was accomplished via [obsidian-buttondown](https://github.com/caro401/obsidian-buttondown).

There are a few benefits to this workflow. 

- I can stay in markdown.
- I can update my ideas from any device I have handy that I've installed Obsidian on already.
- I can sync to GitHub as needed  or to Buttondown.
- I can then decide on Netlify (web) first or Buttondown (email) first.

That's my Wednesday evening excitement. 

Here's some good reading until Sunday:
