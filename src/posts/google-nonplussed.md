Google+ for most users will go away soon. April 2019 warnings and advice to export user data promted me to export my own.

Memories of Wave
================

I was a strong proponent of Google Wave. Yeah. I’m one of *those* people.

Since I’m also a a G-Suite customer, I’m curious how parallel efforts within Google will impact Google+ for G-Suite.

When Google Wave was just starting it was not top of mind that Google Wave might cease to be a stand alone service. By that time, many other Google Apps tools were becoming real-time.

Real-time appealed to shared time windows where a concurrent collaboration was possible. In effect, the asymmetric tools became more symmetric.

Granted, the notion of seeing multiple users editing the same document “in a web page” is more commonplace today even if the use case is… very edge case. Google Wave was by definition, wave ahead… *way* ahead of its time.

Google Minus
============

Google press coverage and punditry has crafted a story about how Google shuts down everything. Google built up a reputation for [ending services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discontinued_Google_services). Then again, there was not a Google before there was a Google.

If the only comparison was to and older company, like Yahoo, then the notion of ending services might not be so novel — it would be [reasonable and expected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discontinued_Yahoo!_services).

Google Pluses
=============

Speaking of April showers, it was only a few years ago (April 2015) that FriendFeed was shut down after Facebook helped it with long term *strategic* planning. Indeed, any commitment to running any service for any advertising company lasts only while there is model for monetization. As soon as there is a better model, the commitment shifts to any service that perpetuates the model. Or… without a model it is bye bye, baby, bye bye.

However, Google G-Suite has a Google+ service that is, by defition, monetized by subscription services. So, the likelihood of Google+ service living on is more predictable. As long there are a significantly large enough number of enterprise customers using the Google+ service, it will continue.
