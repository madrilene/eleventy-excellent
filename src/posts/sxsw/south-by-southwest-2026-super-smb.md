[I submitted a proposal](https://participate.sxsw.com/flow/sxsw/sxsw26/community-voting-sxsw/page/community-voting/session/1750894477655001RMA9) for a panel at SXSW 2026. If you are reading this, I would make the argument that [you should submit a panel too](https://panelpicker.sxsw.com).

I am serious. If you haven't spoken at SXSW before, [you should submit a panel](https://panelpicker.sxsw.com).

🎭 Intended Audience: Managed Intelligence Providers (MIPs) are evolving from Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to enable Superpowers for Small Medium Business (SMB) distinct competitive advantage over larger Enterprise companies.

🤓 Summary: If you ask AI and business luminaries, the first AI fueled one-person unicorn (OPU) is still up for grabs. But beyond valuations, the democratization of AI is having profound impact on small and medium sized business (SMB) beyond basic knowledge work. In this session, we'll explore how Managed Intelligence Providers (MIPs) are evolving from Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to enable Superpowers for SMB with distinct competitive advantages over larger Enterprise companies.

🤔 Takeaway 1️⃣ : Smaller is better when it comes to the AI models that will matter in the physical world

🤔 Takeaway 2️⃣ : AI Marketplaces are going to be the vending machines that enable SMB to snack their way to greater success

🤔 Takeaway 3️⃣ : The droids, Jawas, farmers in Star Wars and not far off from Dirty Jobs with cobots, SLM AI enabled devices, at the vast edge of the network.

🧐 What does the speaker know about the evolution of service providers?
