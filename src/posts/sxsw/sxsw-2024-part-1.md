I'm on Day 3 at SXSW 2024. My biggest failure so far is related to my quantified self: I intended to track the number of steps I've taken and map my routes via GPS/beacons but I missed a setting on my mobile device. Bother.

Disclosure, [I work for IBM](https://jaycuthrell.com/disclosure). At SXSW 2024, [IBM is sponsoring the Artificial Intelligence track](https://www.sxsw.com/conference/artificial-intelligence-track/). So far, I've attended two IBMer sessions.

First, I attended [Quantum Computing: Real, Revolutionary, Right Now!](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/events/PP140519) featuring [Jay Boisseau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayboisseau?trk=public_post_embed-text) of [The Austin Forum on Technology & Society](https://www.linkedin.com/company/austinforum?trk=public_post_embed-text), [Heather Higgins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherhiggs?trk=public_post_embed-text) of [IBM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ibm?trk=public_post_embed-text), [Rima Alameddine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alameddinerima?trk=public_post_embed-text) of [IonQ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ionq.co?trk=public_post_embed-text) , and [Bob Sorensen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-sorensen-b8aa0487?trk=public_post_embed-text) of [Hyperion Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hyperion-research-hpc?trk=public_post_embed-text) on an awesome panel [^panel].

[^panel]: Somehow, the only person I didn't already know on the panel was my fellow IBMer — but now the world is a bit smaller than before. 🤣 *awesome panel*. While the published stories are just beginning to emerge on practical applications of quantum computing, a novel [shipping logistics application of quantum computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA7iopqDm94) from last year was mentioned during the panel. *knapsack problem use cases are fascinating*.

Second, I attended [Why We Should Be Talking About Quantum](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/events/PP133385) featuring [Heather Higgins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherhiggs?trk=public_post_embed-text) of [IBM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ibm?trk=public_post_embed-text) and [Wade Davis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwadedavis?trk=public_post_embed-text) of [Moderna](https://www.linkedin.com/company/modernatx?trk=public_post_embed-text). Some of the practical examples shared highlighted convergence in mRNA research, protein folding research, classical computing, and quantum computing.

The lesson I've learned is that the next day [SXXpress Passes](https://www.sxsw.com/attend/sxxpress/) available in the SXSW GO app need to be refreshed on your device at 9:00 AM CT with no exceptions. If you wait even 15 minutes, you will see the available passes dwindle rapidly.

Serendipity is real. I was able to get into the packed sessions for other IBMers (see above) only because I arrived 45 minutes ahead of time and formed the line/queue for general access. Of course, the benefit to being early is you realize how small the planet is — I ran into attendees from APAC region who also knew people that I know and now we're fast SXSW buddies. 🤓

Tomorrow, I'll be catching a few more IBMer sessions.

- [How AI Is Changing the Art of the Job](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/events/PP142167) featuring [Nickle LaMoreaux](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/speakers/2195699)
- [UX Researchers and Designers Meet Up](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/events/PP132759) featuring [Andreina Dyer](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/speakers/2193899)
- [Why the Future of AI Should be Open](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/events/PP146177) featuring [Dr. Dario Gil](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/speakers/2065523)

### Keynotes

This year the lines for keynotes meant I needed to vote with my feet. Instead of standing in lines, I opted for discussions in hallways and grabbing coffee to catch up with industry attendees, alliance partners, clients/customers, and IBMers. Thankfully, there were helpful folks able to share things I missed! 🙏

### Films

So far, I have not been able to get into any films but I will probably use [SXXpress Passes](https://www.sxsw.com/attend/sxxpress/). I didn't think to take a photo of it but the general access lines/queues for movies are wrapping around entire buildings.

### Sessions

I kept Obsidian open for a few sessions. I'm sharing a few of my notes in a summary format.

[Privacy-in-Progress Redefining the Boundaries of Being Online](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/events/PP1145899) featured [Deonne Castaneda](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/speakers/2199501) and [Tracy Chou](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/speakers/2199278) of Block Party.

- As opposed to moderation, open APIs would permit greater choice to enable use cases and give back power to the user.
- Shoutouts
  - Permission Slip
  - DeleteMe 
  - Privacy Party
- Privacy is a failing of UX
  - Example of changes to ToS included the Zoom debacle claiming ownership of all your meetings.
  - Product Engineering should begin with empathy (Aside: [I agree!](/archive/esteem-is-stem-plus-ethics-plus-empathy/))
  - Examples of Facebook photo albums 6 clicks. “What a waste of precious human moments”
  - Shoutout to [“Privacy by Design”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design)

[Life After Big Tech - Where Are Laid Off Workers Now](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/events/PP141421) featured [Carmen Kiew](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/speakers/2193584) of Codeword Agency, [Joe Lazer](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/speakers/2200385) of [Jon Swartz](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/speakers/2193585) of Dow Jones (MarketWatch), and [Alex Whedon](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/speakers/2193582) of Jenn AI.

- Trends leading to where we are today
  - Over hiring 
  - Bloated and overstuffed organizations
  - AI and automation rendering some amount of labor reductions
- Debates
  - Layoffs as a mask for poor performance
  - Instead of 20 staff with a speciality, you’ll need 2 because of AI
  - If you can be Upwork’d you can be AI’d
  - There are freelancers doing top 1% work getting a 16% increase in their rates and 12% more revenue from AI as their toolchain
  - Corporate grinder mentality and lack of authenticity vs. corporate messaging around employee happiness as a priority
  - Freelance can mean going from 60+ hours of FAANG to 20+ hours of feeling of accomplishment for multiple clients
  - Does a FAANG or hot startup logo on the resume matter?
    - It depends because you still have to be able to market yourself
    - Maybe but any outpourings of help from your network you have built will be more valuable
    - Ex FAANG only matters to Enterprise because Startups will feel like you are overpaid
      - Find the right companies that are outside your prior sector and even non-tech especially can gain higher impact
      - Supply chain, industrial, etc are looking for the tech talent
      - Leapfrogging from missing the last tech wave is also common
      - Consider working with a consulting network company that “launders” work at logos that might be not as useful (Example: Big Company vs a startup)
- Advice for planning before the layoff impacts you was varied:
  - Keep an open note for what you accomplish, something you need a brag list, compliments received aka “your personal hype file”
    - Be proud of what you have learned and done
    - Learn to tell people what you do and your value and impact
    - Keep up with the trends that are impacting industries you can apply your talents to
    - Know what you want for your job and your life as individual motivations
    - Never say never to embracing change because hybrid and remote work wasn’t a news story until it was
    - Markets and work requirements can and do change quickly and you should be ready to reinvent yourself
  - Take all offers to make connections — network, network, network
    - The laid off can become a hiring network
    - Amazing people who were laid off are the same people who are still amazing
  - Join or create private slack/discord channels and back channels that will be incredibly useful in mass layoffs
  - Don’t burn bridges because companies rise, fall, and are often acquired
  - Find the places in the company where you can make the most impact
    - Know when you are on the wrong team (if the problems do not excite you it is the wrong team)
    - Be selective of the problems and the teams you join
    - Ask yourself where you want to put in 10 hours of time to be a skills match and are excited by the problem or the problems to be solved
    - Realize your worth while you still have a job and work on what your story is and the narrative for your next job
    - Be ready to jump to other projects (or a new job)
  - Embace GenAI
    - Don’t confuse building tools with applying tools that make you more effective and efficient — using GenAI doesn't require you to create the GenAI tool
    - Knowing the impact the GenAI tool can have and apply for business impact it is far more valuable than understanding the internals of a GenAI tool
    - Show you can work with AI so that you are accelerating and embracing vs being perceived as someone that will be replaced by AI
    - Learning the practical application of AI is important because people hiring for the future want to know they made an impact on the future of how work gets done
  - BigCo vs. FAANG vs. Startups vs. industry looking for your talents
    - Work on far more interesting problems for potential impact before you assume big tech is the place to start
    - Caring about opportunities for impact is understandable — but that is not just the realm of FAANG
    - Worker-owned tech companies and health insurance should be considered
    - Consulting networks are a decision on partnering and profiting as a balance of spending time selling, support, and the perceptions of loss of individual profits
