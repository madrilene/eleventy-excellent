This week we take a look at Large Language Model (LLM) hype, LLM Operations (LLMOps), Help A Reporter Out (HARO), and Site Reliabiity Engineer (SRE) learnings over the past twenty (20!) years.

# In Case You Missed It

As with the LLM humor above, I've noticed that my comments on LinkedIn might not be visible to all Fudge Sunday newsletter subscribers so I'm experimenting with adding them in a weekly summary batch here.

### LLM

> Epiphany: "LLM" stands for "Large Language Marmalade".  Why? Many businesses will try to smear it on *everything*.

If hammer devotees see everything as nails, then LLM devotees see everything as toast.

### Robotics, Traditions, and Racing

As I once said on LinkedIn, regarding the under 2 second pitstop of Formula 1...

> Insert obligatory arguments around Formula 1 / Formula E rules for automation technology permission space, racing tradition, spectator appetites, and the very real window for seeing refueling / power cell swapping and tires via competitively trained human machine partnership tuned robotic systems — an ever more efficient future seems like the next progression in their respective series.  Also, something something NASCAR, right?

### Platform Engineering

> As I mentioned in a recent webinar, digital product engineering for product led growth needs developer experience centered platform engineering.

### FinOps Family Updates

As an Executive Member on the AWS Partner Advisory Board, it is great to see the FinOps Foundation and FinOps community growing with the addition of a new premier member — Welcome AWS! As I typically reference FinOps as being cloud fiscal responsibility, knowing the team behind AWS Cloud Financial Management (CFM) Services is officially part of the FinOps community really means a lot.

### Modern Mobile Maker

> Being able to open a free visual editor (GitHub) on my glassy stainless steel touch screen mobile terminal (iPhone), edit a file in markdown format, checkin changes, commit changes — all while wirelessly connected to the Internet (5G) — and have a third party batch job service (Netlify) rebuild the file into a page within an entire website rendered as flat HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. optimized for performance (Cloudflare) and served over HTTPS is something I don’t think my 1995 self would recognize… but would relish learning more about.

And I could add to that... *and after publishing to the web, send that web content as an email to over a thousand readers around the world (Buttondown)*

# Here comes LLMOps

I've written about [Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)](https://fudge.org/topics/mlops/) before.

Toast and marmalade aside, the portamanteau of LLM and Operations is likely. Hence, here comes LLMOps.

# 15 years of HARO

Help A Reporter Out (HARO) was founded by [Peter Shankman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shankman) who was becoming more well known in social media circles by 2007 on platforms like Twitter. I signed up for HARO in 2008.

Two of my interviews with reporters even made it on the FM radio. National Public Radio to be exact.

### Microsoft Mobile in 2010

[NPR American Public Media’s Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/2011/06/13/facebook-fatigue-may-be-setting/) (2010) needed a tasty sound bite about the attempts by Microsoft to get their mobile strategy right. I obliged.

> **Cuthrell:** I think it is a lost cause. They are never going to find their way into my pocket.

Back in 2010, Microsoft had a market cap was +$230B.

11 years later, Microsoft has a market cap of $2460B.

In my defense, the goal was to Help A *Reporter* Out not to Help An *Investor* Out. 🥸

Also, Microsoft did in fact find their way into my pocket... just not as an Operating System (OS). Rather, Microsoft earned my appreciation with incredibly polished Office apps on my various corporately managed smart phones for the past +5 years.

### Facebook Fatigue in 2011

Once again, [NPR American Public Media’s Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/2010/07/13/having-missed-mobile-boat-microsoft-name-losing-luster/) (2011) needed a blurb about Facebook and I provided the curmudgeonly old man shakes fist at cloud meme. When asked if Facebook fatigue was setting in... I, again, obliged.

> **Cuthrell:** Absolutely. I think I had 1,000 or more friends or more and I just couldn’t keep track of it. Pokes, and vampire bites or zombie bites or mob hits. But from my point of view, it’s noise.

Clearly, "A place for friends" was not a place for me. Presently, I don't use Meta (Facebook) products if I don't have a solid business reason and don't plan to. 🤷‍♂️

Back in 2011, Facebook was a private company but went on to IPO with a market cap of +$100B. 

12 years later, Meta (Facebook) has a market cap of +$800B.

Once again, in my defense, the goal was to Help A *Reporter* Out not to Help An *Investor* Out. 🥸

### HARO in 2013

Recently, I checked back in with HARO after roughly a decade of, well, not logging in to the system. But, I was amused that a past HARO pitch was still present from 2013!

> Title: First responder and fleet management goes prosumer
> Pitch: Having 4G in your car means that all the things first responders and fleet management technology companies have been able to do are just around the corner for consumers. Police have been using mobile access routers for years. Think of them as those personal wifi hotspot devices you see in your local mobile phone store or the commercials on TV lamenting bad folk music at the coffee place where you get free WiFi. Having this kind of personal hotspot in the car is one possibility but having a high speed connection to the cloud is the other. Imagine dash cam video publishing to YouTube and you aren't too far off from the future.

### HARO (and elsewhere) in 2023

I've re-upped with HARO. We'll see what comes of it. 

Maybe you'll hear me on the radio again soon. Just, please don't construe anything I say as investment advice. 🤣

What's also interesting is that LinkedIn hashtag for "[haro](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=haro)" has less than 200 followers where a the LinkedIn hashtag for "[journorequest](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=journorequest)" has 2000 followers.

In parallel, I'm also refreshing my profile on [Qwoted](https://app.qwoted.com/sources/jay-cuthrell)  too.

# 20 Years of SRE

Time flies. While the tendency to rename teams SRE is understandable, it is arguable that the only true SRE is still done at places like Google.

With that in mind, enjoy these eleven (11) lessons from the field courtesy of the Google SRE team.
