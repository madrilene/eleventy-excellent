# Getting Informed



Now it's time for reading 📖, listening 🎧, and watching 📺 suggestions:

- First, [📖 What’s New in the 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-s-new-in-the-2023-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies) in which [Lori Perri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorilperry/) curates twenty-five (25!) new things to know about in technology.

- Second, [🎧 Combining the Worlds of Automated and Interactive Theorem Proving In Lean (2021)](https://building-better-systems.simplecast.com/episodes/14-leo-de-moura-combining-the-worlds-of-automated-and-interactive-theorem-proving-in-lean) in which [Joey Dodds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joey-dodds-4b462a41/) and [Shpat Morina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shpat/) interview [Leonardo de Moura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-de-moura-26a27b5/) on [LEAN](https://lean-lang.org/about/) functional programming language and interactive theorem prover.

- Third, [📺 Machine-Checked Proofs and the Rise of Formal Methods in Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekYeqvMcaWQ) in which [Leonardo de Moura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-de-moura-26a27b5/) reintroduces [LEAN](https://lean-lang.org/about/) from the viral days of 2020 when [LEAN was covered by WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/the-effort-to-build-the-mathematical-library-of-the-future/?mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired&utm_medium=social&utm_social-type=owned&utm_source=twitter).

## And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales 🎶

To make a point, and not a specific critique of any company or product, it is time for the Shot and Chaser format to return to the newsletter. Ready?

Thesis: Training A.I. models on ulfiltered Internet content and unvetted contributor input might be cost effective... but will not always provide explicitly intended results that are ready for Enterprise use cases.

### Shot

> _2016: "Twitter taught Microsoft’s AI chatbot to be a racist @$$hole in less than a day"_

### Chaser

> _2023: "Techmeme: Amazon's Alexa has been claiming that the 2020 election was stolen citing sources from Rumble and Substack; Amazon says the errors were fixed (Cat Zakrzewski)"_

[Techmeme: Amazon's Alexa has been claiming that the 2020 election was stolen citing sources from Rumble and Substack; Amazon says the errors were fixed (Cat Zakrzewski)](https://www.techmeme.com/231007/p10#a231007p10)

Expect communications and product marketing teams across all A.I. product companies to begin shifting to marketing copy choices that reflect the connotation of "renewed commitment to [ insert best practices here]" and similar phrasing. So, the real question remains: Will product engineering teams match the pace of the marketing copy in both practice and practical applications of A.I.?

## Now we've come so far, so fast 🎶

Let's isolate the A.I. references out of twenty-five (25) entries on the 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies. There are seven (7) Innovation Trigger candidates and three (3) Peak of Inflated Expectations candidates that mention A.I. or M.L. in some way and I'll link to a prior Fudge Sunday issue that explored the concept or a short YouTube video snippet. 🤓

### Innovation Trigger 

- Generative Cybersecurity A.I. — aka [the fire extinguisher that may lower insurance policy premiums](https://fudge.org/archive/cyber-ground/)
- (A.I.) Augmented FinOps — aka [human machine partnerships in FinOps](https://fudge.org/archive/little-green-tags/)
- Neuro-Symbolic A.I. — aka [layering 2019 era MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhymId8dr5Q)
- Casual A.I. — aka [cause and effect trained autonomous systems](https://fudge.org/archive/social-telecom-2030/)
- A.I. Simulation — aka ['Shall we play a game?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9l5jSDL50))
- (A.I) Reinforcement (Machine) Learning (M.L.) — aka [feedback loops](https://fudge.org/archive/social-telecom-2030/)
- (A.I) Federated Machine Learning (M.L.) — aka [practical applications of homomorphic encryption](https://fudge.org/archive/designed-sealed-delivered/)

### Peak of Inflated Expectations

- A.I. TRiSM — aka Trust, Risk (R little i), as well as Security Management aka the Shot and Chaser section of this newsletter 👆
- Generative A.I. — aka [Clippy 2: Electric Boogaloo](https://fudge.org/archive/generative-ai-thru-this/)
- A.I. Augmented — aka [My Tireless Robotic Pair Programmer](https://fudge.org/archive/gitops-down-on-it/)

The links provided are not meant to be exhaustive. One goal I have for the newsletter archives is to implement tagging keywords for all my prior posts. Until then, this is just a manual pass at keyword searches for the concepts mentioned in the Hype Cycle until my Obsidian vaults can be exposed for wiki-like use.

Going forward, if A.I. is truly on pace to go through a Trough of Disillusionment, keeping a mark of time and major changes in direction will be useful waypoints. At the risk of another musical reference...

So, what will be the next big thing in for A.I. and what's next?

Until then… Place your bets!
