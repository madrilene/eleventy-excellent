Fudge Sunday readers will recall my use of songs as inspiration. While the newsletter is not going back to the series format, the lyrics of [SchoolHouse Rock - Mother Necessity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBx-ilTzLec) are appropriate.

The topic of ever more responsive, effective, and efficient data [analytics](/topics/analytics) is not new to Fudge Sunday newsletter. Today, there are rapidly updating cloud native projects and stories from the communities and companies involved in [Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org), [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org), [Presto](https://prestodb.io), [Spark](https://spark.apache.org), [Superset](https://superset.apache.org), [Trino](https://trino.io), and [many more](https://cncf.landscape2.io/?group=projects-and-products).

## Shot

Just 132 days ago, [Compute.AI](https://compute.ai) was mentioned in Fudge Sunday #214 ["Are You Gonna Go Parquet"](https://fudge.org/archive/are-you-gonna-go-parquet/).

A few readers were curious about how to "kick the tires" and get a demo of [Compute.AI](https://compute.ai).

## Chaser

Last week, [the first public GitHub repository appeared for Compute.AI](https://github.com/ComputeAI/computeAI-integrations). Practitioners can now launch a containerized deployment of the ComputeAI SQL engine.

The [Compute.AI](https://compute.ai) team has posted updates on LinkedIn for the [announcement itself](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7148386664908828672/) as well as a [video demo on the integration with Jupyter Notebook](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/computeai_computeai-integration-with-jupyter-notebook-activity-7148747924464619520-NNfy).

Also, there is a video demo on the [integration](https://github.com/ComputeAI/computeAI-integrations/blob/main/superset/README.md) with [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org).

As such, it's time to [add to the topics list](/topics/computeai). 🤓

# Getting Informed

When reading about cloud native projects, it is common to see references to the [Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works/). Over almost a quarter of a century, ASF has grown to [almost 300 projects](https://projects.apache.org).

One such project, [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org), began in 2017 within Netflix and was donated to ASF in 2018 to promote the efficacy and longevity of a modern approach to low-level standards involving very large tables. This rapid promotion of the project within ASF is because the community is focused on ensuring [Iceberg does certain things very well](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/).

Then, in 2021, a commercial entity known as [Tabular](https://tabular.io) was formed and funded to simplify, secure, and streamline the adoption of Iceberg.

Commercial options for Iceberg besides Tabular are [growing](https://iceberg.apache.org/vendors/). There are recognizable companies like Cloudera and Snowflake, but there are smaller companies like [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com) and [Starburst](https://www.starburst.io) that deserve attention as well — not to mention the Hudi play from companies like [Onehouse](https://www.onehouse.ai).

In 2024, expect to see more community activities including practitioner challenges that promote *the art of the possible* drawing upon various projects mentioned in this newsletter.

So, what will be the next big thing in Apache Iceberg and related projects?

Until then… Place your bets!
