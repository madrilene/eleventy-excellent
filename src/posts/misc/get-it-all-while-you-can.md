Getting Informed
================

Several readers have asked to revisit topics from prior newsletter issues from a year ago. One such topic is the reality of repatriation from edge to core to cloud and I’ve decided to industrialize this concept as continuous commensurate repatriation.

Let’s get into it.

Sometimes it just feels so right 🎶
----------------------------------

First, it’s worth looking back at the notion of edge to core to cloud that is blurring which I covered this time last year. To recap:

* *[“the very notion of needing to move data from edge to core to cloud“](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-and-the-way-that-gravity-pulls-on-everyone-673047?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)*
* *[”](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-and-all-points-in-between-679406?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)[distributed edge data centers [..] happen slowly then [..] appear all at once](https://www.opengridalliance.org/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)[”](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-and-all-points-in-between-679406?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)*
* *[“companies that [..] operate outside of purely terrestrial modality“](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-all-along-the-watchtower-679407?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)*
* *[“move the micro data centers into orbit”](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-get-high-on-a-new-thing-679408?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)*
* *[data centers < information centers < knowledge centers < wisdom centers](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-i-don-t-know-where-i-ll-be-tomorrow-679416?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)*

And other times so wrong 🎶
--------------------------

Second, the topic of moving from edge to core to cloud for workloads sometimes feels similar to the “Riddle of the Sphinx”[1](#footnote-1) but with security and finance concerns being the limiters to finding an answer. Indeed, sometimes the “xOps solves this” meme answers invite the Sphinx to feast upon pundit travelers.

So, again, let’s look back at a few recent issues for guidance from March 2022:

* *[DevSec, SCA, xAST, RASP, DevSecOps, FinOps, and code search](https://sunday.fudge.org/p/fudge-sunday-needle-in-a-fullstack-1094857)*
* *[FinOps within industrialization of the software development pipeline](https://sunday.fudge.org/p/fudge-sunday-once-in-a-pipeline-1084136)*
* *[Portmanteaus for operationalizing Finance, Data Management, Machine Learning, Communications, and more](https://sunday.fudge.org/p/fudge-sunday-everything-counts-in-ops-amounts-1073115)*

Also, consider recent posts from Grey Meyer[2](#footnote-2), Ed Sim[3](#footnote-3), and Tom Tunguz[4](#footnote-4):

* *[“why developer security is the next big thing“](https://whatshot.substack.com/p/whats-in-enterprise-itvc-299)*
* *[“roadmaps are our best guess at the moment“](https://www.finddataops.com/p/a-roadmap-is-a-marathon)*
* *[“opting instead for a data notebook“](https://tomtunguz.com/spicy-future-data/)*

The change goes on and on and on and on 🎶
-----------------------------------------

Third, if there is a multiverse for multicloud, then perhaps there is an applicable Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) meme. But, it’s important we be careful about click driven punditry and tech journalism that seeks to make everything into an overly simplistic zero-sum game.[5](#footnote-5)

So, ***(spoiler alert?)*** perhaps we’re all on a path akin to residual self-confirming equilibrium that academics like [Yakov Babichenko](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Babichenko%2C+Y) or [Aviad Rubinstein](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Rubinstein%2C+A) may generalize one day[6](#footnote-6).

In effect, there are so many R’s (beyond the normal 6) to consider as I outlined in a newsletter issue from last year:[7](#footnote-7)


> *[a superfecta of R’s at the minimum seems more likely instead of assuming everything goes to the public cloud. Retain Relegate Renovate Resuscitate Retire Replatform Repurchase Refactor Rehost Repatriate Refinance Reinvest Rationalize Recombine (etc…)](https://sunday.fudge.org/p/fudge-sunday-reflecting-and-projecting-664131)*

When what we think of as data centers are becoming micro data centers as invisible or nondescript base pedestals in neighborhoods, unmarked rooms in unmarked floors in unremarkable buildings, and floating overhead a la Starlink / Kuiper /etc. – it's gonna get funky. So, it’s reasonable to expect four more *R’s* might be *Relative, Reallocate, Readied, Realistic*. 

To gather just a few examples that many readers might recognize, the VxRail, Nutanix, and Scale Computing approaches all proved the need for discreet clusters for smaller and smaller things in data centers. Now, as ARM, discrete in situ cooling[8](#footnote-8), and increasingly commensurate placement of workloads takes hold (again?) it's gonna be fascinating.

[Precision immersion cooling from Iceotope at HPE Discover 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/StorageReview/comments/vsyhyl/weve_been_talking_a_lot_about_liquid_cooling_but/)So, on a long enough timeline, if there are k8s/k3s clusters running in your local Chick-fil-A then it's incredibly likely that evolved approaches are going to eventually filter out to other firms and plate / power / ping modalities.[9](#footnote-9) Further, the economics of deterministic power, weight, cooling, and geometry in data center footprint are only going to become ever finer grained year over year. 

Place your bets…
