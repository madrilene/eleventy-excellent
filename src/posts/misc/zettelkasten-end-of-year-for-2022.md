This week we take a look at my Zettelkasten end of year favorites for 2022.

# Sidebar

First, if you are reading this update, I'd like to thank you for your patience as I explore new content formats. Also, this is a currently a \_free\_ newsletter and I pay the fees[^0] that enable this newsletter to be delivered to your inbox — so, no worries if you want to click your unsubscribe link below. 🤓

Second, I have been approached by an advertiser. After gathering feedback from a few Fudge Sunday readers that use said advertiser with their own communities[^1], I may consider experimenting with a \_"Links From Our Sponsor"\_ section next year. 🤔

# Getting Informed

You might recall my [end of 2021 Zettlekasten update](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-sunday-zettelkasten-end-of-year-favorites) from this same time last year. Well, it's time for the end of year recap before my end of year predictions next week.

In keeping with quasi-yearly tradition, I’ll share a few of my favorite links that inspired me for weekly newsletter output. Also, a common email reply from my readership this year was as follows:

> \_Jay, where do you come up with this stuff?\_

I read a lot of online resources that often get organized as files in Obsidian. I also compulsively add to my Reading List or bookmark all my browser tabs when researching a specific topic.

Sometimes I'll see a pattern in technology news coverage[^2] that reminds me of a song. Sometimes links or topics collide during the week or as late as Sunday afternoon and \_then\_ I am reminded of a song.

So far, Fudge Sunday has ~50 posts published for 2022. For this issue, that list was narrowed down to my personal Top 10 and I've included the links that inspired the posts and extracted them below.

# Last Year This Year

Last year I predicted [the prices of chips would be headed to lower prices in 2022](https://fudge.org/archive/fudge-sunday-cheap-as-chips-in-2022/). So at the risk of moving goal posts a year (or several), the FRED curve this month is where the FRED curve was in May 2016 and one need only look at the history of the peaks going back to the 1980s to understand my prior prediction.

[![Screenshot 2022-12-18 at 7.07.57 PM.png](https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/5c958749-180c-4480-aa63-50b27eb64d15.png)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU334413334413A)

Now... What will be my prediction next week for 2023?

Until then... Place your bets!
