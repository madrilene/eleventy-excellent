## 🔙 Throwback Thursday for 2025-08-07
Similar to my prior Markets Monday format change, I'm working on a historical format change for Throwback Thursday. 

More soon...

   
## ✅ Final Thoughts Friday for 2025-08-08
I believe the biggest story this week was electrical power grid resilience and the law within data center friendly states like Texas.

https://www.techmeme.com/250807/p47#a250807p47

In modern data center site selection, the electrical power grid has become increasingly important. However, the ability to self-generate power in the form of on-site generation is becoming essential to operational excellence.
   
## 🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday for 2025-08-09
Friday arrives and the bury begins, or was it stage craft with storytelling savvy?

### August 8

https://www.techmeme.com/250808/p25#a250808p25

Considering the theatrical notion of so-called backdoors, kill switches, etc. the coverage timing of value chain companies (TSMC, etc.) and the expedient outcome (capitulation?) of export policy logjams — the arguably sudden resolution for NVIDIA interests is a bit on the nose.

To see what I mean, let's start by backing the news truck up a bit by *[ checks notes... ]* a whole week...

# #OpenToWork Weekly

I participated in a [#NeverSearchAlone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH3nzRdwYPA) [#JSC](https://www.phyl.org/jsc) after rebooting [Cuthrell Consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting) and [joining NexusTek](https://cuthrell.consulting/blog/jay-cuthrell-joins-nexustek/).
