# Spicy Edition Sunday for 2024-06-23

Welcome to 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday!

Uncover the spicy inspiration behind this week's Fudge Sunday edition, packed with deep links and fresh insights. 🔥

As a quick reminder, longer form [Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org/) topics are posted weekly on at [https://fudge.org/](https://fudge.org/).

## 🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday

🗓️ Last week, a seven ( 7 ) day roundup of [Hot Fudge Daily](https://hot.fudge.org) was included in [Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org/). Based on feedback, this week will be the last digest in the series and my workflow will revert to the original longer form content of [Fudge Sunday](https://fudge.org). 

🆕 As of this update, [Hot Fudge Daily](https://hot.fudge.org) the weekly digest will be posted in [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://hot.fudge.org/) as "free" weekly content. This seems to strike a balance for different reader interests and helps me streamline my workflow as a writer.

<p>Looking at the week behind for the tech market.</p><p>I typically ask Siri how NASDAQ is doing and wait to hear it if is a big change or not. Siri logic on the definition of what to say if the there is +/- &lt; 1% seems to be varied by day of attempts.
