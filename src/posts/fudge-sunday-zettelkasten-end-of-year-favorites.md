[![Start the week more informed](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png "Start the week more informed")](https://cuthrell.com/favicon.png)This week we take a look at my Zettelkasten end of year favorites. Enjoy!

 **Getting Informed**

My approach to bookmarking started with hand editing HTML files in the mid 1990s. Sadly, [link rot](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-a-decade-of-github-167088?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) has not been kind over the past +25 years.🤣

More recently, I’ve been trying to refine my [Zettlekasten](https://thefortunelabs.com/obsidian-note-taking-app/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) with Google Keep, Zapier, Slack, Matter, GitHub, and Obsidian while sunsetting my use of Evernote. So, I’d like to share just a few of my favorite links that have inspired me over the past year and helped inform issues of this newsletter.

 **One last thing...**

**Thank you for reading.**

Writing has been immensely rewarding for me.

Writing is the process by which you realize what you think and what you understand are two different things.
