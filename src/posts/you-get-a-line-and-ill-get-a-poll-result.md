================

You might recall, I put a poll in the newsletter[1](#footnote-1) and on LinkedIn[2](#footnote-2) too. I also summarized the results over on LinkedIn Creator (aka Pulse)[3](#footnote-3) for good measure.

So, to recap, the setup and poll question was simple:

> 🤔🔮🗳📊

> Imagine taking a poll in the year 2025...

At the same time, math should govern most suitable placement decisions. Again, the *edge to core to (public) cloud* conversation should be data driven throughout the workload lifecycle and across the workload landscape itself.

There ain’t no crawdads in this lake 🎶

Next, expect more use cases[6](#footnote-6) at the edge in smaller spaces[7](#footnote-7) and far more places. Effectively, this is how the *edge use case* is becoming the *use case at the edge*.

And with all those new places handling new data too, new approaches to data security will have to match pace.
