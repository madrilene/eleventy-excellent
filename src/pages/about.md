Based on the [companion website](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/) of Andy Bell's talk 'Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager'. It takes over a core functionality: Using Tailwind CSS to generate CSS variables based on design tokens.

Like buildexcellentwebsit.es, this starter uses modern CSS, fluid type & space, flexible Layouts and Progressive Enhancement, wrapped in a basic template, ideal for personal websites and other small projects.

The aim is to hopefully spread the use of this _excellent_ workflow. To work with it efficiently you should be familiar with [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/), [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) and [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).

- Remix the original: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/build-excellent-websites

Edit your preferences (colors, fonts, fluid text sizes etc.) in `src/assets/design-tokens`.
